            "We sell these products to the various cannabis control authorities under supply agreements that are subject to terms that allow for renegotiation of sale prices and termination at the election of the applicable cannabis control authority.In particular, the cannabis control authorities have in the past and may in the future choose to stop purchasing our products, may change the prices at which they purchase our products, may return our products to us and, in certain circumstances, may cancel purchase orders at any time including after products have been shipped.For the year ended December 31, 2023, we had approximately $96.5 million in sales to cannabis control authorities in Canada.Research and Development Activities and Intellectual PropertyGinkgoThe collaboration and license agreement between Ginkgo and the Company (the “Ginkgo Collaboration Agreement”) enabled us to produce certain cultured cannabinoids at commercial scale at a fraction of the cost compared to traditional cultivation practices.The Ginkgo Collaboration Agreement was amended in June 2021 to enable accelerated commercialization of such cultured cannabinoids, ultimately resulting in the Company’s launching of its first cultured cannabinoid product containing cannabigerol (“CBG”) in the second half of 2021.These cultured cannabinoid molecules are identical to those produced by plants grown using traditional cultivation but are created by leveraging the power of biological manufacturing via fermentation.These cultured cannabinoids include rare cannabinoids that are difficult to produce at high purity and scale through traditional cultivation.The Ginkgo Strategic Partnership enabled Cronos to produce large volumes of these cultured cannabinoids from custom yeast strains by leveraging the fermentation infrastructure at Cronos Fermentation.However, in August 2023, Cronos announced the planned wind-down of the Cronos Fermentation facility and has listed the facility for sale.As a result, we are no longer operating facilities that leverage the patented intellectual property under the Ginkgo Strategic Partnership, although Cronos may leverage this intellectual property, either through production at the Peace Naturals Campus or through a contract manufacturer, and Cronos continues to utilize these cultured cannabinoids in our products sold in Canada.Ginkgo has filed certain patent applications pertaining to biosynthesis of cannabinoids to protect the intellectual property developed as part of the research progressing under the Ginkgo Strategic Partnership.Under the partnership, Cronos is the exclusive licensee of the intellectual property covered by the patent applications for the target cannabinoids.The Ginkgo Strategic Partnership contemplates the performance of licensed R&D activities in the U.S. in order to produce cultured cannabinoids, and such activities are to be conducted in compliance with all applicable laws regarding controlled substances.We intend to distribute the target cannabinoids globally, where permitted by applicable law, and have received confirmation from Health Canada that this method of production is permitted under the Cannabis Act.Cronos FermentationCronos Fermentation is a fermentation and manufacturing facility in Winnipeg, Manitoba.The facility provided the fermentation and manufacturing capabilities we used to capitalize on the Ginkgo Strategic Partnership, by enabling us to produce the target cannabinoids contemplated under the Ginkgo Collaboration Agreement at commercial scale with high quality and high purity.In August 2023, Cronos announced the planned wind-down of the Cronos Fermentation facility and has listed the facility for sale.Competitive ConditionsCompetitive Conditions in CanadaWe face competition in all aspects of our business in the Canadian adult-use and medical markets.",
            "As the demand for cannabis increases as a result of the legalization of adult-use cannabis in Canada under the Cannabis Act, we believe that new competitors will continue to enter the market.The principal factors on which we compete with other Canadian license holders are product quality, innovation, intellectual property, brand recognition and price.We believe the Company’s strong capitalization resulting from the Altria Investment, along with the Spinach® and Lord Jones® brand recognition and differentiation in the Canadian adult-use market, will enable us to provide better quality consumer products, grow our Canadian business and strengthen our market position in Canada.However, a rapidly evolving and stringent federal regulatory framework affects all areas of our business.See “—Regulatory Framework in Canada” for further information on the regulatory framework applicable to our Canadian business.We also face competition from illegal market participants that are unlicensed and unregulated.As these illegal market participants do not comply with the regulations governing the cannabis industry, their operations may also have significantly lower costs.Any inability of the Canadian federal or provincial law enforcement authorities to enforce existing laws prohibiting the unlicensed cultivation and sale of cannabis and cannabis-based products could result in the perpetuation of the illegal market for cannabis.9Table of ContentsIn addition to competition from illegal market participants, we also face competition from licensed cannabis competitors that fail to comply with the regulations governing the cannabis industry when developing and selling cannabis products.If regulatory authorities are delayed in, or fail to, effectively restrict the sale and distribution of these non-compliant cannabis products, such regulatory non-compliance by our competitors may have adverse effects on our business and the perception of cannabis use.Competitive Conditions Outside of CanadaWe face competition when entering new markets.The principal factors on which we compete are product quality, innovation, intellectual property, brand recognition, price and physician familiarity.We believe we are positioned to enter certain markets in Europe in a meaningful way while continuing to operate and penetrate the markets we currently serve, such as in Israel and Germany, due to our strong capitalization resulting from the Altria Investment, extensive experience and expertise in the highly regulated cannabis industry in Canada, which can be leveraged when entering new markets or growing existing operations, and strong partnerships with local distributors.We believe these factors will enable us to develop greater market penetration, provide a greater variety of quality consumer products and enter into new markets and strengthen our existing market position in Europe, Australia and Israel.However, a patchwork of regulatory frameworks and federal regulations in these various regions also affects our ability to compete in emerging markets as evolving regulations and federal frameworks have the potential to affect all areas of our business.Altria Strategic InvestmentAltria Investment and Investor Rights AgreementAs of December 31, 2023, Altria beneficially owned 41.1% of our common shares and had the right to acquire additional common shares under its pre-emptive and top-up rights as discussed under “Pre-Emptive Rights and Top-Up Rights” below.Investor Rights AgreementIn connection with the Altria Investment, we entered into the Investor Rights Agreement with Altria pursuant to which Altria received certain governance rights that are summarized below.Board RepresentationThe Investor Rights Agreement provides that, for so long as Altria and certain of its affiliates (the “Altria Group”) continue to beneficially own at least 40% of our issued and outstanding common shares and the size of our board of directors (the “Board”) is seven directors, we agree to nominate for election as directors to the Board four individuals designated by Altria (the “Altria Nominees”).",
            "In addition, for so long as the Altria Group continues to beneficially own greater than 10% but less than 40% of our issued and outstanding common shares, Altria is entitled to nominate a number of Altria Nominees that represents its proportionate share of the number of directors comprising the Board (rounded up to the next whole number) based on the percentage of our issued and outstanding common shares beneficially owned by the Altria Group at the relevant time.At least one Altria Nominee must be independent as long as Atria has the right to designate at least three Altria Nominees and the Altria Group’s beneficial ownership of our issued and outstanding common shares does not exceed 50%.The Investor Rights Agreement also provides that, subject to certain exceptions, for so long as Altria is entitled to designate one or more Altria Nominees, we agree to appoint to each committee established by the Board such number of Altria Nominees that represents Altria’s proportionate share of the number of directors comprising the applicable Board committee (rounded up to the next whole number) based on the percentage of our issued and outstanding common shares beneficially owned by the Altria Group at the relevant time.Approval RightsThe Investor Rights Agreement also grants Altria, until the Altria Group beneficially owns less than 10% of our issued and outstanding common shares, approval rights over certain transactions that may be undertaken by us.We have agreed that, among other things, we will not (and will use our commercially reasonable efforts to cause our affiliates not to), without the prior written consent of Altria:•consolidate or merge into or with another person or enter into any similar business combination;•acquire any shares or similar equity interests, instruments convertible into or exchangeable for shares or similar equity interests, assets, business or operations with an aggregate value of more than C$100,000,000, in a single transaction or a series of related transactions;•sell, transfer, cause to be transferred, exclusively license, lease, pledge or otherwise dispose of any of our or any of our significant subsidiaries’ assets, business or operations in the aggregate with a value of more than C$60,000,000;•except as required by applicable law, make any changes to our policy with respect to the declaration and payment of any dividends on our common shares;10Table of Contents•subject to certain exceptions, enter into any contract or other agreement, arrangement, or understanding with respect to, or consummate, any transaction or series of related transactions between us or any of our subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any related parties, on the other hand, involving consideration or any other transfer of value required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated pursuant to the Securities Act; or•engage in the production, cultivation, advertisement, marketing, promotion, sale or distribution of cannabis or any Related Products and Services (as defined in the Investor Rights Agreement) in any jurisdiction, including the U.S., where such activity is prohibited by applicable law as of the date of the Investor Rights Agreement (subject to certain limitations).Exclusivity CovenantPursuant to the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement, until the earlier of:•the six-month anniversary of the date on which the Altria Group beneficially owns less than 10% of our issued and outstanding common shares; and•the six-month anniversary of the termination of the Investor Rights Agreement,Altria has agreed to make us its exclusive partner for pursuing cannabis opportunities throughout the world (subject to certain limited exceptions).Pre-Emptive Rights and Top-Up RightsPursuant to the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement and provided the Altria Group continues to beneficially own at least 20% of our issued and outstanding common shares, Altria has a right to purchase, directly or indirectly by another member of the Altria Group, upon the occurrence of certain issuances of common shares by us (including issuances of common shares to Ginkgo under the Ginkgo Collaboration Agreement (each, a “Ginkgo Issuance”)) (each, a “Triggering Event”) and subject to obtaining the necessary approvals, up to such number of our common shares issuable in connection with the Triggering Event which will, when added to our common shares beneficially owned by the Altria Group immediately prior to the Triggering Event, result in the Altria Group beneficially owning the same percentage of our issued and outstanding common shares that the Altria Group beneficially owned immediately prior to the Triggering Event (in each case, calculated on a non-diluted basis).",
            "The price per common share to be paid by Altria pursuant to the exercise of these pre-emptive rights will be, subject to certain limited exceptions, the same price per common share at which the common shares are sold in the relevant Triggering Event; provided that if the consideration paid in connection with any such issuance is non-cash, the price per common share that would have been received had such common shares been issued for cash consideration will be determined by an independent committee (acting reasonably and in good faith); provided further that the price per common share to be paid by Altria pursuant to the exercise of its pre-emptive rights in connection with a Ginkgo Issuance will be C$16.25 per common share.In addition to (and without duplication of) the aforementioned pre-emptive rights, the Investor Rights Agreement provides Altria with top-up rights, exercisable on a quarterly basis, whereby, subject to obtaining the necessary approvals and for so long as the Altria Group beneficially owns at least 20% of our issued and outstanding common shares, Altria has the right to subscribe for such number of common shares in connection with any Top-Up Securities (as defined below) that we may, from time to time, issue after the date of the Investor Rights Agreement, as will, when added to the common shares beneficially owned by the Altria Group prior to such issuance, result in the Altria Group beneficially owning the same percentage of our issued and outstanding common shares that the Altria Group beneficially owned immediately prior to such issuance.“Top-Up Securities” means any of our common shares issued:•on the exercise, conversion or exchange of our convertible securities issued prior to the date of the Investor Rights Agreement or on the exercise, conversion or exchange of our convertible securities issued after the date of the Investor Rights Agreement in compliance with the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement, in each case, excluding any of our convertible securities owned by any member of the Altria Group;•pursuant to any share incentive plan of the Company;•on the exercise of any right granted by us pro rata to all shareholders to purchase additional common shares and/or other securities of the Company (other than a right issued in a rights offering in which Altria had the right to participate);•in connection with bona fide bank debt, equipment financing or non-equity interim financing transactions with our lenders, in each case, with an equity component; or•in connection with bona fide acquisitions (including acquisitions of assets or rights under a license or otherwise), mergers or similar business combination transactions or joint ventures undertaken and completed by us, in each case, other than (A) common shares issued pursuant to Altria’s pre-emptive right and (B) common shares issued pursuant to the Ginkgo Collaboration Agreement.The price per common share to be paid by Altria pursuant to the exercise of its top-up rights will be, subject to certain limited exceptions, the volume-weighted average price of our common shares on the TSX for the 10 full trading days preceding such exercise by Altria; provided that the price per common share to be paid by Altria pursuant to the exercise of its top-up rights in connection with the issuance of common shares pursuant to the exercise of options or warrants that were outstanding on the date of closing of the Altria Investment will be C$16.25 per common share without any set off, counterclaim, deduction or withholding.11Table of ContentsOpen Market PurchasesThe Altria Group is permitted to acquire our common shares in the open market at any time and in any amount.Registration RightsThe Investor Rights Agreement provides Altria with the right, subject to certain limitations and to the extent permitted by applicable law, to require us to use reasonable commercial efforts to file a prospectus under applicable securities laws and/or a registration statement, qualifying our common shares held by Altria for distribution in Canada and/or the U.S.",
            "In addition, the Investor Rights Agreement provides Altria with the right to require us to include our common shares held by Altria in any proposed distribution of common shares in Canada and/or the U.S. by us for our own account.Commercial ArrangementsIn connection with the Altria Investment, we and Altria have entered into certain commercial arrangements (the “Commercial Arrangements”), pursuant to which Altria may provide us with consulting services on matters which may include R&D, marketing, advertising and brand management, government relations and regulatory affairs, finance, tax planning, logistics and other corporate administrative matters.The services under the Commercial Arrangements are provided on customary terms and for a services fee payable by us that is equal to Altria’s reasonably allocated costs plus 5%.Protection of Intangible AssetsThe ownership and protection of our intellectual property rights is a significant aspect of our future success.Currently, we rely on trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets, technical know-how and proprietary information.We seek to protect our intellectual property by strategically seeking and obtaining registered protection where appropriate, developing and implementing standard operating procedures to protect inventions, germplasm, trade secrets, technical know-how and proprietary information and entering into agreements with parties that have access to our inventions, germplasm, trade secrets, technical know-how and proprietary information, such as our partners, collaborators, employees and consultants, to protect confidentiality and ownership.We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our inventions, germplasm, trade secrets, trademarks, technical know-how and proprietary information by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.In addition, we have sought trademark protection in many jurisdictions, including Canada, Australia, the U.S., China, Israel and Europe.Our ability to obtain registered trademark protection for cannabis-related goods and services, in particular for cannabis itself, may be limited in certain countries outside of Canada.For example, in the U.S., registered federal trademark protection is only available for goods and services that can be lawfully used in interstate commerce; the PTO is not currently approving any trademark applications for U.S.Schedule I cannabis, or certain goods containing U.S. hemp-derived CBD (such as dietary supplements and food) until the FDA provides clearer guidance on the regulation of such products.In Europe, trademarks cannot be obtained for products that are “contrary to public policy or accepted principles of morality.” Accordingly, our ability to obtain intellectual property rights and enforce intellectual property rights against third-party uses of similar trademarks may be limited in certain jurisdictions.Human Capital ResourcesCronos is an innovative global cannabinoid company committed to building disruptive intellectual property by advancing cannabis research, technology and product development.",
            "With a passion to responsibly elevate the consumer experience, Cronos is building an iconic brand portfolio.Our employees are critical to achieving this mission.In order to compete and succeed in our highly competitive and rapidly evolving industry, it is crucial that we continue to attract, develop, motivate and retain skilled, talented and passionate employees.The Company’s people strategy seeks to build a winning team and to foster a community where everyone feels included and empowered to do their best work.As of December 31, 2023 we had 356 full-time employees.Of our full-time employees, 231 were in Canada, 49 were in the U.S., and 76 were in Israel.None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.Compensation and Benefits.Our compensation program is designed to attract, motivate and reward talented individuals who possess the skills necessary to support our business objectives, assist in the achievement of our strategic goals and create long-term value for our shareholders.We believe we offer competitive compensation and benefits in each of our locations, including long-term equity awards to eligible employees under our 2020 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan to reward and retain talented individuals and align employee and shareholder interests.Safety, Health and Well-being.The safety, health and well-being of our employees are paramount to the Company.We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of health and welfare programs, including benefits that support their physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status.See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Operations in Israel” for risks to the safety, health and well-being of our employees in Israel due to the Israel-Hamas War.Employee Engagement, Development and Training.We are committed to developing our talent and building an agile and resilient organization with a workforce with the skillset to effectively adapt to changing business needs in order to best position the Company for success.We seek to foster a culture of employee learning, innovation and a drive to succeed through a talent development strategy12Table of Contentsthat adapts to changing business needs.Management is an active enabler of our people strategy as we seek to recruit, retain and engage top talent that will maximize our business performance.Employees are enabled to succeed through our communicated behaviors, development training opportunities, our performance management program and pay for performance philosophy, and using their voice in our employee engagement survey.Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and Ethical Business Practices.We believe that a diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment mitigates the risk of groupthink, ensures that the Company has the opportunity to benefit from all available talent and enhances, among other things, our organizational strength, problem-solving ability and opportunity for innovation.We continue to focus on understanding our diversity and inclusion strengths and opportunities and executing on a strategy to support further progress.We are committed to hiring, developing, and promoting employees with diverse backgrounds.We are actively reviewing diversity across our Company to drive greater progress.We welcome, embrace, and celebrate all our employees.We seek to ensure this inclusivity is achieved through regular training and support for our employees.We maintain a whistleblower policy and anonymous hotline for the confidential reporting of any suspected policy violations and provide training and education to our global workforce with respect to our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and related policies.Regulatory Framework in CanadaLicenses and Regulatory FrameworkThe Cannabis Act and the Cannabis Regulations (the “Cannabis Regulations”) establish six classes of licenses:•cultivation;•processing;•sale for medical purposes;•analytical testing;•research; and•cannabis drug.The Cannabis Regulations also create subclasses for cultivation licenses (standard cultivation, micro-cultivation and nursery) and processing licenses (standard processing and micro-processing).",
            "Different licenses and each sub-class therein carry differing rules and requirements that are intended to be proportional to the public health and safety risks posed by each category and sub-class.Federal RegimeThe Cannabis Act provides a licensing and permitting scheme for, among other things, the cultivation, processing, testing, packaging, labeling, distribution, sale, possession and disposal of adult-use cannabis, implemented by regulations promulgated under the Cannabis Act.The Cannabis Act and Cannabis Regulations include, among other things, strict specifications for the plain packaging and labeling and analytical testing of all cannabis products as well as stringent physical and personnel security requirements for all federally licensed cultivation, processing and sales sites.Health Canada allows license holders to export cannabis products with appropriate export permits.Export permits issued by Health Canada are specific to each shipment and may only be obtained for medical or scientific purposes.To apply for a permit to export cannabis, a license holder must submit significant information to Health Canada including information about the substance to be exported (including description, intended use, quantity) and the importer.As part of the application, applicants are also generally required to provide a copy of the import permit issued by a competent authority in the jurisdiction of final destination and to make a declaration to Health Canada that the shipment does not contravene the laws of the jurisdiction of the final destination or any country of transit or transshipment.The Cannabis Act requires the federal government to conduct a review of the Cannabis Act after three years, which commenced in September 2022.The scope of this statutory review includes, among other things, consideration of (i) the administration and operation of the Cannabis Act, (ii) the impact of the Cannabis Act on public health, (iii) the health and consumption habits of young persons, (iv) the impact of cannabis on indigenous persons and communities and (v) the impact of the cultivation of cannabis plants in a dwelling-house.The federal Minister of Health is expected to table a report in both Houses of Parliament by March 2024.The report resulting from the statutory review may recommend and/or lead to the amendment, removal or addition of provisions in or to the Cannabis Act which could adversely affect our business.13Table of ContentsIn addition to the current medical and adult-use regimes under the Cannabis Act, Health Canada has also been considering the implementation of a cannabis health product regime for products with potential therapeutic uses that would not require practitioner oversight.Between June and September 2019, Health Canada held a public consultation titled “Potential Market for Cannabis Health Products (CHPs) that would not Require Practitioner Oversight.” The consultation sought feedback from Canadians on the kinds of cannabis health products they would be interested in if such products were made available in Canada.A summary report of the consultation results was published by Health Canada in September 2020.Given the results of the consultation, Health Canada has indicated that it intends to obtain external scientific advice on the appropriate evidence standards required to demonstrate safety, efficacy and quality in cannabis health products, with the information it gathers informing the next steps on a potential implementation of a cannabis health product regime.",
            "Health Canada intends to engage with key stakeholders further in 2024.In June 2021, Health Canada opened a consultation into the use of flavors in inhaled cannabis extracts as it claims that the availability of flavors is one of the factors that contributes to the increase in cannabis vaping in youth and young adults.As part of this consultation, Health Canada released proposed regulations that contemplate restricting the production, sale, promotion, packaging and labelling of inhaled cannabis extracts from having a flavor, other than the flavor of cannabis.The proposed amendments would apply equally to inhaled cannabis extracts sold for medical and non-medical purposes.The proposed amendments were pre-published in June 2021 and the consultation period closed in September 2021.No expected in-force date has been publicized.In March 2023, Health Canada opened a consultation into potential amendments to the Cannabis Regulations, to streamline and clarify existing requirements; eliminate inefficiencies in the regulations such as duplication between requirements; and reduce administrative and regulatory burden, while continuing to meet the public health and public safety objectives of the Cannabis Act.The consultation closed in May 2023 and Health Canada is reviewing the comments received through the public consultation.The proposed amendments to the Cannabis Regulations are expected to be published in spring 2024 and the consultation period is expected to last 30 days.In December 2023, Health Canada released guidance on cannabis products deliberately made with intoxicating cannabinoids other than delta-9-tetrayhydrocannabinol.Health Canada defines “intoxicating cannabinoids” as cannabinoids that bind to and activate the type 1 cannabinoid receptor (“CB1 receptor”).This guidance recommends that license holders apply the regulatory controls currently applicable to THC to all other cannabinoids that Health Canada defines as “intoxicating cannabinoids” in order to minimize the risks of accidental consumption, overconsumption and adverse effects.Health Canada’s guidance comes at a time when certain provincial cannabis regulators (such as those in Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta) are actively evaluating whether to permit the sale of, or whether to impose limits on the levels of, of certain cannabinoids.Provincial and Territorial DevelopmentsWhile the Cannabis Act provides for the regulation by the Canadian federal government of, among other things, the commercial production of cannabis and the sale of medical cannabis, the various provinces and territories of Canada regulate certain aspects of adult-use cannabis, including the distribution, sale, minimum age requirements and places where cannabis can be consumed.The governments of each Canadian province and territory have implemented regulatory regimes for the distribution and sale of cannabis for adult-use purposes which continue to evolve over time.Most provinces and territories have announced a minimum age for possession and consumption of 19 years old, except for Québec and Alberta, where the minimum age is 21 and 18, respectively.In addition, provinces and territories may impose additional licensing requirements and restrictions on sales, distribution and promotion which are more stringent than those at the federal level.For example, the Société Quebécoise du Cannabis (the “SQDC”), the exclusive distributor of cannabis in the province and the sole retail and online vendor in Québec, does not permit cannabis vaporizers or other high THC non-edible cannabis products to be sold through its channels.The SQDC has also placed significant restrictions on the types of edibles that may be sold through its channels, prohibiting edibles that are sweet, confectionary, dessert, chocolate or any other product SQDC considers attractive to persons under 21 years of age.",
            "Similarly, the Prince Edward Island Cannabis Management Corporation does not allow cannabis vaporizers to be sold through its channels.Provincial distributors may also take different positions on the sale and distribution of products with various cannabinoids (including tetrahydrocannabivarin and cannabinol).Licenses and Regulatory Framework in IsraelIn Israel, cannabis is subject to the Israeli Dangerous Drugs Ordinance [New Version], 5733 – 1973 (the “Ordinance”), and its sale and use are prohibited unless applicable licenses have been obtained.Licenses to cultivate, produce, possess and use cannabis for medical or research purposes in Israel are granted by the Israel Medical Cannabis Agency within the Israeli Ministry of Health (the “Yakar” and the “Israeli MOH,” respectively).Until the Reform Regulations (as described below) take effect, patients must also obtain licenses either directly from physicians who have been authorized to grant patient licenses or from the Yakar following a request from the patient’s physician in order to purchase and consume medical cannabis.14Table of ContentsIn January 2019, the Israeli government approved, in principle, the export from Israel of medical cannabis products that meet applicable quality standards under the strict supervision of the Israeli authorities.Only products that can be directly marketed to patients (including smoking products, oils, and vaporizer products) may be exported, and only to those countries that have signed the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs and that have explicitly approved the import of cannabis.The export of plant substances, including seeds and tissue cultures, is not permitted.In October 2020, the Israeli MOH initiated a pilot program in which certain medical cannabis companies were permitted to export their products, and the Yakar issued guidelines relating to the export of medical cannabis products.These guidelines set forth the process and conditions for obtaining an export license, which can only be issued to an applicant already holding a valid Yakar license.In December 2021, the Director General of the Israeli MOH announced the appointment of a committee (the “CBD Committee”) intended to examine the possibility of excluding CBD from being considered a “dangerous drug” under the Ordinance.In February 2022, the CBD Committee published its recommendations.The CBD Committee concluded that it would be advisable to exclude CBD from the Ordinance and to allow CBD use, other than in food and cosmetics products, provided that the aggregate concentration of THC does not exceed 0.2%.The CBD Committee further recommended that during the next two years, CBD components not be approved as a component in food, food supplements, and cosmetics and that this issue be re-examined by a committee designated by the Israeli MOH.In March 2022, the Israeli MOH adopted the conclusions of the CBD Committee and published a draft order for public comments which excludes CBD from the Ordinance while setting the threshold of aggregate concentration of THC (or any structural derivative of THC) in any product, at 0.3%.",
            "Cosmetics and food products would be handled by specific regulations in such fields.As of January 2024, no final order was issued, and CBD has yet to be excluded from the Ordinance.On January 31, 2022, the Economic Affairs Committee of the Israeli Parliament held a discussion regarding the adverse effect on the local cannabis industry of significant import of medical cannabis.The discussion was concluded with a request to the Israeli MOH to study the matter and consider banning medical cannabis import until a balance is reached in the market between the import and export of medical cannabis.The Israeli MOH has not yet publicly issued a study on the matter.In July 2022, a committee appointed by the Director General of the Israeli MOH concluded that it would be advisable to reform the medical cannabis regulatory framework by transitioning from the grant of personal patient licenses to the issuance of prescriptions available through public healthcare services.In August 2022, the new regulations adopting this reform (the “Reform Regulations”) were presented for public comments.The Reform Regulations propose to amend the Ordinance to allow medical cannabis to be prescribed by trained and certified physicians and to be held and distributed by pharmacies.The Reform Regulations aim to ease the Yakar’s regulations relating to medical cannabis prescriptions and accelerate research and innovation in the field.The Reform Regulations were approved by the Israeli Parliament’s health committee in June 2023, and published in July 2023.The Reform Regulations were expected to enter into effect in December 2023, however, due to the situation in Israel and the Israel-Hamas War, its entrance into effect was postponed until March 29, 2024.On December 31, 2023, the Israeli MOH published proposed changes to the current directives and guidelines of the Yakar and Israeli MOH, which remained open for public comments until January 21, 2024.In June 2022, 11 cannabis manufacturers (including Cronos Israel G.S Manufacturing Ltd.) (the “Petitioners”) filed an administrative petition to the District Court in Jerusalem regarding the Yakar’s decision to issue a constructive license (i.e., a license for dealing with medical cannabis, without a direct contact with the drug, such as brokering medical cannabis transactions) (the “Constructive License”).The Petitioners claim that the procedure and requirements for other licenses (e.g., for cultivation or production), granted by the Yakar, are unreasonably more stringent than those of the Constructive License.On January 5, 2023, the District Court in Jerusalem ordered the Israeli MOH to stop the issuance of Constructive Licenses for 60 days, and to formulate a clear policy regarding the issuance of such Constructive Licenses.On February 12, 2023, the director general of the Yakar published a decision regarding the Constructive Licenses, in response to the District Court’s order.The decision clarifies the Yakar’s authority to grant Constructive Licenses for the import/export of medical cannabis.On August 30, 2023, following recommendation by the Israeli MOH’s committee, the Director General of the Israeli MOH appointed an additional committee (the “2023 Committee”).",
            "The 2023 Committee’s mandate is to comprehensively examine which cannabinoids and parts of the cannabis plant have a psychoactive-addictive effect and whether the classification of cannabis as a “dangerous drug” under the Ordinance is warranted.In September 2023, the Israeli MOH sought public comments and input about the 2023 Committee’s subject matter.The 2023 Committee was scheduled to publish its recommendations by January 1, 2024, but to date, has not done so.Cronos Israel LicensesCronos Israel maintains the following certificates and corresponding permits: (1) full Good Agricultural Practices (“GAP”) certification, including a permit to propagate and cultivate at the full capacity of the greenhouse; and (2) Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMP”) and Good Distribution Practices (“GDP”) certificates and permits to produce and distribute dried flower, cannabis oils and pre-rolls.Licenses and Regulatory Framework in Other JurisdictionsWe and our joint venture partners, strategic investments and strategic partners are subject to comprehensive and evolving regulations in each jurisdiction in which we and they operate.All aspects of the production, manufacture and distribution of cannabis products are15Table of Contentsregulated and subject to licensing regimes.These regulations and licensing regimes vary by jurisdiction and we, our joint venture partners, strategic investments and strategic partners spend significant time, effort and money to comply with the applicable requirements.We seek to comply with export laws in connection with distributing our products in other jurisdictions by obtaining export permits from Health Canada.Our strategic partners are responsible for compliance with import laws and local regulatory requirements (including laws related to distribution of medical products) in jurisdictions in which they operate.Available InformationWe are subject to the informational requirements of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and, in accordance with the Exchange Act, we also file reports with and furnish other information to the SEC.The public may obtain any document that we file with or furnish to the SEC from the SEC’s Electronic Document Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system, which can be accessed at www.sec.gov, or via the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval Plus, which can be accessed at www.sedarplus.com, as well as from commercial document retrieval services.Copies of this Annual Report may be obtained on request without charge from our Corporate Secretary, corporate.secretary@thecronosgroup.com, telephone: +1-416-504-0004.We also provide access without charge to all of our SEC filings, including copies of this Annual Report, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as well as Section 16 reports on Forms 3, 4 or 5, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing or furnishing, on our website located at https://thecronosgroup.com."
