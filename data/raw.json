[{"text": " ITEM 1.BUSINESSGeneralCronos is incorporated under the laws of the Province of British Columbia with principal executive offices located at 111 Peter Street, Suite 300, Toronto, Ontario M5V 2H1.Our telephone number is +1-416-504-0004, our website is https://thecronosgroup.com/ and the investor relations section of our website is https://ir.thecronosgroup.com/.All references to our website are inactive references, are for informational purposes only and are not intended to incorporate any information from or referenced on our website into this Annual Report.Our common shares are currently listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (\u201cTSX\u201d) and on the NASDAQ Global Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) under the trading symbol \u201cCRON.\u201dDescription of the BusinessOverviewCronos is an innovative global cannabinoid company committed to building disruptive intellectual property by advancing cannabis research, technology and product development. With a passion to responsibly elevate the consumer experience, Cronos is building an iconic brand portfolio.Cronos\u2019 diverse international brand portfolio includes Spinach\u00ae, PEACE NATURALS\u00ae and Lord Jones\u00ae.StrategyCronos seeks to create value for shareholders by focusing on four core strategic priorities:\u2022growing a portfolio of iconic brands that responsibly elevate the consumer experience;\u2022developing a diversified global sales and distribution network;\u2022establishing an efficient global supply chain; and\u2022creating and monetizing disruptive intellectual property.Discontinued OperationsIn the second quarter of 2023, Cronos exited its U.S. hemp-derived cannabinoid product operations.The exit of the U.S. operations represented a strategic shift that has a major effect on Cronos\u2019 operations and financial results, and as such, qualifies for reporting as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of net loss and comprehensive loss. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to reflect the discontinued operations classification of the U.S. operations.For further detail on the discontinuation of the U.S. operations, see Note 2 \u201cDiscontinued Operations\u201d to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report.Business SegmentsBeginning in the second quarter of 2023, following the exit of our U.S. operations, Cronos is reporting through one consolidated segment, which includes operations in both Canada and Israel.In Canada, Cronos operates two wholly owned license holders under the Cannabis Act (Canada) (the \u201cCannabis Act\u201d), Peace Naturals Project Inc. (\u201cPeace Naturals\u201d), which has production facilities near Stayner, Ontario, and Thanos Holdings Ltd., known as Cronos Fermentation (\u201cCronos Fermentation\u201d), which has a production facility in Winnipeg, Manitoba. In November 2023, Cronos announced Peace Naturals had entered into an agreement for the sale and leaseback of the Peace Naturals Campus.See \u201cOperations and Investments\u2014Sale and Leaseback of the Peace Naturals Campus\u201d for more information.In August 2023, Cronos announced the planned wind-down of Cronos Fermentation, and has listed the facility for sale.In Israel, the Company operates under the IMC-GAP, IMC-GMP and IMC-GDP certifications required for the cultivation, production and marketing of dried flower, pre-rolls and oils in the Israeli medical market.Operations and InvestmentsPeace Naturals Campus / Cronos GrowCoThe production facilities at the Peace Naturals Campus and the production facilities of Cronos GrowCo are licensed by Health Canada under the Cannabis Act to engage in the cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of dried flower, cannabis seeds, cannabis plants, cannabis extracts, cannabis topicals and cannabis edibles, among other prescribed activities.Cronos FermentationThe production facility at Cronos Fermentation is licensed by Health Canada under the Cannabis Act to engage in the processing and distribution and sale of dried flower, cannabis seeds, and cannabis plants, among other prescribed activities, which includes the production of cultured cannabinoids. The facility also holds a license for Analytical Testing under the Cannabis Regulations.As noted above, in August 2023, Cronos announced the planned wind-down of Cronos Fermentation and has listed the facility for sale.IsraelIn Israel, the Company operates under the IMC-GAP, IMC-GMP and IMC-GDP certifications required for the cultivation, production and marketing of dried flower, pre-rolls and oils in the Israeli medical market.4Table of ContentsOperations Outside of Canada and IsraelCronos anticipates that it will continue expanding in the geographic markets outside of Canada and Israel in which we currently participate and entering new geographic markets.By leveraging operational, manufacturing and regulatory expertise, quality standards and procedures and intellectual property, we believe that we are well-positioned to effectively access these markets. Subject to applicable regulatory approvals, strategic international business opportunities pursued by us could include:\u2022production, distribution, sales and marketing in jurisdictions that have passed legislation to legalize the production, distribution and possession of cannabis products at all relevant levels of government; and\u2022the export of cannabis products to markets that permit the import of such products.We distribute PEACE NATURALS\u00ae branded products along with other white-labeled cannabis products in the German medical market through our strategic partnership with Cansativa, a leading German cannabis company.In Australia, we distribute cannabis products through a distribution relationship with Vitura (formerly known as Cronos Australia Limited).We seek to conduct business only in jurisdictions where we believe it is legal to do so and where such operations remain compliant with our listing obligations with the TSX and Nasdaq. Determining whether a business activity is legal in a jurisdiction may require judgment since laws, rules, regulations and licenses may not be clear and legal interpretation and advice of counsel may vary.If a business activity in which we engage in any jurisdiction is determined to be illegal, we could be subject to fines, penalties, reputational harm, delisting from securities exchanges and material civil, criminal and regulatory litigation and proceedings or be enjoined from doing business in the applicable jurisdiction.See \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Risks Relating to Regulation and Compliance\u2014We operate in highly regulated sectors where the regulatory environment is rapidly developing, and we may not always succeed in complying fully with applicable regulatory requirements in all jurisdictions where we carry on business.\u201dSale and Leaseback of the Peace Naturals CampusOn November 27, 2023, the Company announced that Peace Naturals had entered into an agreement (the \u201cSale Agreement\u201d) with Future Farmco Canada Inc. (\u201cFuture Farmco\u201d) for the sale and leaseback of the Peace Naturals Campus. Pursuant to the terms of the Sale Agreement, Future Farmco has agreed to acquire the Peace Naturals Campus for an aggregate purchase price of C$23 million cash, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, including (a) Future Farmco having given written notice that it has satisfied itself in its sole, absolute and subjective discretion with respect to all aspects of the property, including title to the property, the physical condition of the property, zoning, environmental matters, financial matters including financing of the purchase price, and its review of the deliverables on or before the first business day that is 180 calendar days following the date of the Sale Agreement; (b) the Company having obtained all requisite approvals for the amendment of its licensed site perimeter from Health Canada on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Company, acting reasonably, prior to the end of the first business day following the later of: (i) 180 calendar days after the date of the Sale Agreement; or (ii) 75 calendar days after the satisfaction or waiver of Future Farmco\u2019s condition described above; and (c) the parties having agreed, no later than 75 calendar days following the date of the Sale Agreement, to a form of lease to be entered into at closing for the Company to lease a portion of the Peace Naturals Campus (the \u201cLease Condition\u201d). On February 29, 2024, the Company entered into a waiver and amending agreement with Future Farmco, pursuant to which the parties waived the Lease Condition.See \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Risks Relating to Our Growth Strategy\u2014There can be no assurance that the regulatory approvals will be obtained or that the other closing conditions for the sale and leaseback of the Peace Naturals Campus will be satisfied or waived in a timely manner or at all.\u201d As of the date of this Annual Report, the parties have agreed to a form of lease to be entered into at closing.At closing, the parties expect to enter into a lease agreement for portions of the Peace Naturals Campus, which will include an initial five-year term and one five-year renewal option that may be exercised by the Company.The Company has the right to terminate the lease without penalty anytime after the second anniversary of the lease by giving written notice at least 12 months prior to termination. The leased premises will be identified and agreed between both parties prior to closing.Joint Ventures/Strategic InvestmentsWe have established two strategic joint ventures in Canada and Israel.Additionally, we hold approximately 9.6% of the issued capital of Vitura Health Limited (\u201cVitura\u201d), which we account for as equity securities with a readily determinable fair value, and approximately 13.7% of the issued capital of NatuEra S.\u00e0.r.l.(\u201cNatuera\u201d), which we account for as equity securities without a readily determinable fair value, as of December 31, 2023.5Table of ContentsOur ownership interest in each of our joint ventures is summarized in the table below.##table 0##(i) We define ownership interest as the proportionate share of net income to which we are entitled; equity interest may differ from ownership interest shown above. We consolidate the financial results of Cronos Israel and account for our other joint ventures under the equity method of accounting.See Note 1 \u201cBackground, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 4 \u201cInvestments\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.(ii) A strategic joint venture with Kibbutz Gan Shmuel (\u201cGan Shmuel\u201d), an Israeli agricultural collective settlement, for the production, manufacturing and global distribution of medical cannabis, consisting of a cultivation company (Cronos Israel G.S.Cultivation Ltd.), a manufacturing company (Cronos Israel G.S.Manufacturing Ltd.), a distribution company (Cronos Israel G.S.Store Ltd.) and a pharmacy company (Cronos Israel G.S.Pharmacy Ltd., collectively, \u201cCronos Israel\u201d). We hold a 70% equity interest in the cultivation company and a 90% equity interest in each of the manufacturing, distribution and pharmacy companies.(iii) A strategic joint venture with a group of investors led by Bert Mucci (the \u201cGreenhouse Partners\u201d), a Canadian large-scale greenhouse operator.Each of Cronos and the Greenhouse Partners owns a 50% equity interest in Cronos GrowCo and has equal representation on its board of directors.Strategic Investment in PharmaCann, Inc.On June 14, 2021, Cronos USA Holdings Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, purchased an option (the \u201cPharmaCann Option\u201d), with an exercise price of $0.0001 per share, to acquire an approximately 10.5% ownership stake in PharmaCann, Inc. (\u201cPharmaCann\u201d) on a fully diluted basis for total consideration of approximately $110.4 million. PharmaCann is a leading vertically integrated U.S. cannabis company that has a broad geographic footprint in the U.S. and has built an efficient, effective and scalable operating model.The PharmaCann Option exercise will be based upon various factors, including the status of U.S. federal cannabis legalization, as well as regulatory approvals, including in the states where PharmaCann operates that may be required upon exercise.Following the exercise of the PharmaCann Option, the Company and PharmaCann will enter into commercial agreements that would permit each party to offer its products through the other party\u2019s distribution channels.As of December 31, 2023, the Company\u2019s ownership percentage in PharmaCann on a fully diluted basis was approximately 5.9%.Under the terms of the Company\u2019s investment in PharmaCann, the Company\u2019s rights to nominate an observer or a director to the PharmaCann board of directors could be lost if the Company\u2019s ownership drops below 6% on a fully diluted basis and it sells or transfers all or any portion of the option (subject to certain exceptions).No U.S. Schedule I Cannabis-Related ActivitiesThough a number of states in the U.S. have authorized the cultivation, distribution or possession of U.S.Schedule I cannabis and U.S.Schedule I cannabis containing products to various degrees and subject to various requirements or conditions, U.S.Schedule I cannabis continues to be a Schedule I controlled substance under the U.S.Controlled Substances Act (the \u201cCSA\u201d).Therefore, the cultivation, manufacture, distribution and possession of U.S.Schedule I cannabis violates federal law in the U.S. unless a U.S. federal agency, such as the DEA, grants a registration for a specific activity, such as research, with U.S.Schedule I cannabis.We do not engage in any activities related to U.S.Schedule I cannabis in the U.S.The Ginkgo Strategic Partnership contemplates the performance of licensed R&D activities in the U.S. in order to produce cultured cannabinoids, but such activities are conducted in compliance with all applicable laws regarding controlled substances.Brand PortfolioWe are committed to building a portfolio of iconic brands that responsibly elevate the consumer experience.In Canada, we sell a variety of cannabis products through wholesale channels under both our core adult-use brands, Spinach\u00ae and Lord Jones\u00ae, and under our core wellness platform, PEACE NATURALS\u00ae. In addition, PEACE NATURALS\u00ae cannabis products are currently available in the Israeli and German medical markets.6Table of Contents##table 1##Core Adult-Use BrandsSpinach\u00ae is a mainstream adult-use cannabis brand focused on friends, fun and legendary cannabis.The Spinach\u00ae brand portfolio includes cannabinoid products in a wide range of formats including dried flower, pre-rolls, vaporizers and edibles.The Spinach\u00ae brand also has two sub-brands, SOURZ by Spinach\u00ae and Spinach FEELZ\u2122.SOURZ by Spinach\u00ae is a line of multi-colored, multi-flavored edibles in a variety of cannabinoid ratios in a distinctive \u201cS\u201d shaped gummy, featuring proprietary flavor masking technology.Spinach FEELZ\u2122 prominently features rare cannabinoids in a range of product formats, designed to deliver unique and enhanced experiences made possible through proprietary blends of rare cannabinoids alongside common cannabinoids, like delta-9-tetrayhydrocannabinol (\u201cTHC\u201d). Each product is formulated to help adult consumers, \u201cFeelz.The Way You Want.\u201dLord Jones\u00ae is a premium adult-use cannabis brand that goes above and beyond to unlock differentiated ways to experience cannabis.The Lord Jones\u00ae brand portfolio includes cannabis products in the pre-roll, vaporizer and edible categories.Core Wellness BrandPEACE NATURALS\u00ae is a global wellness platform committed to producing high-quality cannabis products.It is focused on building and shaping the global cannabis wellness market and promoting a holistic approach to wellness.The Company currently distributes products under PEACE NATURALS\u00ae for Canadian, Israeli and German medical markets.Cronos Marketing CodeIn 2021, Cronos released its Marketing Code, which is designed to responsibly move the emerging cannabis industry forward. Cronos believes that those below the legal age of consumption should not be targeted in an adult-use cannabis market.Cronos recognizes there is a clear need for standards.The principles in the Cronos Marketing Code apply to all marketing activities of all Cronos brands globally and are communicated to all business partners in any work they do on the Company\u2019s behalf.The Marketing Code represents Cronos\u2019 commitment to responsible marketing standards.The code standards are:\u2022Our advertising will be targeted to adults.\u2022We will highlight responsible cannabis consumption and any people depicted in any imagery will be adults.\u2022Our brand websites and social media will be designed for adults.\u2022Our marketing events will be targeted to adults and will promote responsible cannabis consumption.\u2022We will provide our customers with facts and substantiate our claims.Global Sales and Distribution - Principal MarketsCronos has developed a diversified global sales and distribution network. We have built a distribution footprint in Canada through the adult-use and medical markets, as well as a distribution channel for the Israeli medical market.Canadian Market and Distribution\u2022Medical Market.Following the closure of the Medical Cannabis by Shoppers Drug Mart platform, our PEACE NATURALS\u00ae medical cannabis products are sold in Canada through various third-party distributors.\u2022Adult-Use.We currently sell dried flower, pre-rolls, vaporizers and edibles through our core adult-use brands, Spinach\u00ae and Lord Jones\u00ae, to cannabis control authorities in all provinces of Canada and the Yukon territory, except Saskatchewan, where we sell to private-sector retailers, subject to the relevant province\u2019s or territory\u2019s product or other restrictions and requirements.As the Company\u2019s supply chain grows, the Company continues to expand its portfolio of cannabis products for the existing markets in Canada.7Table of ContentsMarkets and Distribution Outside of Canada\u2022Israel. Cronos Israel holds the IMC-GAP, IMC-GMP and IMC-GDP certifications required for the cultivation, production and marketing of dried flower, pre-rolls and oils in Israel.Cronos Israel distributes PEACE NATURALS\u00ae branded cannabis products to the Israeli medical market through pharmacies.See \u201c\u2014Licenses and Regulatory Framework in Israel.\u201d\u2022Europe.In September 2023, Cronos established a strategic partnership with Cansativa, a leading German cannabis company, to distribute PEACE NATURALS\u00ae branded products along with other white-labeled cannabis products in the German medical market\u2022Australia.We distribute cannabis products in Australia through a distribution relationship with Vitura (formerly known as Cronos Australia Limited).We continue to seek new international distribution channels in jurisdictions that have legalized the production, distribution and possession of cannabis products at all relevant levels of government.Global Supply ChainCronos is focused on establishing an efficient global supply chain by seeking to develop industry-leading methodologies and best practices at Cronos Fermentation and the Peace Naturals Campus and leveraging this expertise to create beneficial production partnerships. We plan to continue to develop a global supply chain, which will employ a combination of wholly-owned production facilities, third party suppliers and global production partnerships, all of which will support the manufacturing of cannabinoid-based consumer goods.Canadian Supply Chain\u2022Peace Naturals Campus.The Peace Naturals Campus is licensed for cannabis production and the manufacturing of certain cannabis products.The Peace Naturals Campus is engaged in processing, finishing, packaging and shipping activities, as well as R&D activities, including cannabinoid product formulation, product development, tissue culture and micro propagation.In the fourth quarter of 2023, Cronos announced that its wholly owned subsidiary entered into an agreement with Future Farmco, a vertical farming company, for the sale and leaseback of the Peace Naturals Campus, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein. As described under \u201cOperations and Investments\u2013Sale and Leaseback of the Peace Naturals Campus\u201d above, the parties plan to enter into a lease agreement upon closing for portions of the Peace Naturals Campus.\u2022Cronos GrowCo.The Cronos GrowCo production facility is licensed for cannabis production and the manufacturing of certain cannabis products.Under its current licenses, Cronos GrowCo is permitted to sell certain cannabis products to other license holders in the wholesale channel, as well as to provincial cannabis control authorities.Cronos GrowCo holds Global GAP and ICANN GAP certifications (equivalent to IMC-GAP) for the export of dried flower to Israel.\u2022Cronos Fermentation.Cronos Fermentation is licensed for cannabis production and the manufacturing of certain cannabis products.In August 2023, Cronos announced the planned wind-down of Cronos Fermentation and has listed the facility for sale. Cronos Fermentation engaged in R&D to produce high-quality cultured cannabinoids at commercial scale.\u2022Third-party Supply and Manufacturing Agreements.In the ordinary course of our business, we enter into spot market purchase agreements and supply agreements with suppliers of dried flower and other cannabis products.Our supply agreements, for the most part, do not obligate us to purchase minimum quantities of products and generally contain provisions permitting cancellation of orders or termination on notice.We also enter into contract manufacturing agreements with other license holders for certain manufacturing and processing services related to our products.Supply Chain Outside of Canada\u2022Cronos Israel.Cronos Israel holds the IMC-GAP, IMC-GMP and IMC-GDP certifications required for the cultivation, production, distribution, and marketing of dried flower, pre-rolls and oils in Israel. Cronos Israel distributes PEACE NATURALS\u00ae branded cannabis products to the Israeli medical market.See \u201c\u2014Licenses and Regulatory Framework in Israel\u201d for more information on our licenses in Israel.Major CustomersMajor customers are customers for which sales equaled or exceeded 10% of our consolidated net revenues for the year.We had three major customers, Ontario Cannabis Retail Corporation, Alberta Gaming, Liquor and Cannabis Commission, and BC Liquor Distribution Branch, which accounted for approximately 34%, 21%, and 11%, respectively, of our consolidated net revenues, before excises taxes, for the year ended December 31, 2023.We mitigate credit risk through verification of the customers\u2019 liquidity prior to the authorization of material transactions.8Table of ContentsGovernment ContractsIn Canada, we sell cannabis products to cannabis control authorities in all provinces of Canada and the Yukon territory, except for Saskatchewan (where we sell to private-sector retailers), where each such cannabis control authority is the sole wholesale distributor and in certain provinces, the sole retailer, of cannabis products. We sell these products to the various cannabis control authorities under supply agreements that are subject to terms that allow for renegotiation of sale prices and termination at the election of the applicable cannabis control authority.In particular, the cannabis control authorities have in the past and may in the future choose to stop purchasing our products, may change the prices at which they purchase our products, may return our products to us and, in certain circumstances, may cancel purchase orders at any time including after products have been shipped.For the year ended December 31, 2023, we had approximately $96.5 million in sales to cannabis control authorities in Canada.Research and Development Activities and Intellectual PropertyGinkgoThe collaboration and license agreement between Ginkgo and the Company (the \u201cGinkgo Collaboration Agreement\u201d) enabled us to produce certain cultured cannabinoids at commercial scale at a fraction of the cost compared to traditional cultivation practices. The Ginkgo Collaboration Agreement was amended in June 2021 to enable accelerated commercialization of such cultured cannabinoids, ultimately resulting in the Company\u2019s launching of its first cultured cannabinoid product containing cannabigerol (\u201cCBG\u201d) in the second half of 2021.These cultured cannabinoid molecules are identical to those produced by plants grown using traditional cultivation but are created by leveraging the power of biological manufacturing via fermentation.These cultured cannabinoids include rare cannabinoids that are difficult to produce at high purity and scale through traditional cultivation.The Ginkgo Strategic Partnership enabled Cronos to produce large volumes of these cultured cannabinoids from custom yeast strains by leveraging the fermentation infrastructure at Cronos Fermentation. However, in August 2023, Cronos announced the planned wind-down of the Cronos Fermentation facility and has listed the facility for sale.As a result, we are no longer operating facilities that leverage the patented intellectual property under the Ginkgo Strategic Partnership, although Cronos may leverage this intellectual property, either through production at the Peace Naturals Campus or through a contract manufacturer, and Cronos continues to utilize these cultured cannabinoids in our products sold in Canada.Ginkgo has filed certain patent applications pertaining to biosynthesis of cannabinoids to protect the intellectual property developed as part of the research progressing under the Ginkgo Strategic Partnership.Under the partnership, Cronos is the exclusive licensee of the intellectual property covered by the patent applications for the target cannabinoids.The Ginkgo Strategic Partnership contemplates the performance of licensed R&D activities in the U.S. in order to produce cultured cannabinoids, and such activities are to be conducted in compliance with all applicable laws regarding controlled substances. We intend to distribute the target cannabinoids globally, where permitted by applicable law, and have received confirmation from Health Canada that this method of production is permitted under the Cannabis Act.Cronos FermentationCronos Fermentation is a fermentation and manufacturing facility in Winnipeg, Manitoba.The facility provided the fermentation and manufacturing capabilities we used to capitalize on the Ginkgo Strategic Partnership, by enabling us to produce the target cannabinoids contemplated under the Ginkgo Collaboration Agreement at commercial scale with high quality and high purity.In August 2023, Cronos announced the planned wind-down of the Cronos Fermentation facility and has listed the facility for sale.Competitive ConditionsCompetitive Conditions in CanadaWe face competition in all aspects of our business in the Canadian adult-use and medical markets. As the demand for cannabis increases as a result of the legalization of adult-use cannabis in Canada under the Cannabis Act, we believe that new competitors will continue to enter the market.The principal factors on which we compete with other Canadian license holders are product quality, innovation, intellectual property, brand recognition and price.We believe the Company\u2019s strong capitalization resulting from the Altria Investment, along with the Spinach\u00ae and Lord Jones\u00ae brand recognition and differentiation in the Canadian adult-use market, will enable us to provide better quality consumer products, grow our Canadian business and strengthen our market position in Canada.However, a rapidly evolving and stringent federal regulatory framework affects all areas of our business.See \u201c\u2014Regulatory Framework in Canada\u201d for further information on the regulatory framework applicable to our Canadian business.We also face competition from illegal market participants that are unlicensed and unregulated. As these illegal market participants do not comply with the regulations governing the cannabis industry, their operations may also have significantly lower costs.Any inability of the Canadian federal or provincial law enforcement authorities to enforce existing laws prohibiting the unlicensed cultivation and sale of cannabis and cannabis-based products could result in the perpetuation of the illegal market for cannabis.9Table of ContentsIn addition to competition from illegal market participants, we also face competition from licensed cannabis competitors that fail to comply with the regulations governing the cannabis industry when developing and selling cannabis products.If regulatory authorities are delayed in, or fail to, effectively restrict the sale and distribution of these non-compliant cannabis products, such regulatory non-compliance by our competitors may have adverse effects on our business and the perception of cannabis use.Competitive Conditions Outside of CanadaWe face competition when entering new markets. The principal factors on which we compete are product quality, innovation, intellectual property, brand recognition, price and physician familiarity.We believe we are positioned to enter certain markets in Europe in a meaningful way while continuing to operate and penetrate the markets we currently serve, such as in Israel and Germany, due to our strong capitalization resulting from the Altria Investment, extensive experience and expertise in the highly regulated cannabis industry in Canada, which can be leveraged when entering new markets or growing existing operations, and strong partnerships with local distributors.We believe these factors will enable us to develop greater market penetration, provide a greater variety of quality consumer products and enter into new markets and strengthen our existing market position in Europe, Australia and Israel. However, a patchwork of regulatory frameworks and federal regulations in these various regions also affects our ability to compete in emerging markets as evolving regulations and federal frameworks have the potential to affect all areas of our business.Altria Strategic InvestmentAltria Investment and Investor Rights AgreementAs of December 31, 2023, Altria beneficially owned 41.1% of our common shares and had the right to acquire additional common shares under its pre-emptive and top-up rights as discussed under \u201cPre-Emptive Rights and Top-Up Rights\u201d below.Investor Rights AgreementIn connection with the Altria Investment, we entered into the Investor Rights Agreement with Altria pursuant to which Altria received certain governance rights that are summarized below.Board RepresentationThe Investor Rights Agreement provides that, for so long as Altria and certain of its affiliates (the \u201cAltria Group\u201d) continue to beneficially own at least 40% of our issued and outstanding common shares and the size of our board of directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) is seven directors, we agree to nominate for election as directors to the Board four individuals designated by Altria (the \u201cAltria Nominees\u201d). In addition, for so long as the Altria Group continues to beneficially own greater than 10% but less than 40% of our issued and outstanding common shares, Altria is entitled to nominate a number of Altria Nominees that represents its proportionate share of the number of directors comprising the Board (rounded up to the next whole number) based on the percentage of our issued and outstanding common shares beneficially owned by the Altria Group at the relevant time.At least one Altria Nominee must be independent as long as Atria has the right to designate at least three Altria Nominees and the Altria Group\u2019s beneficial ownership of our issued and outstanding common shares does not exceed 50%.The Investor Rights Agreement also provides that, subject to certain exceptions, for so long as Altria is entitled to designate one or more Altria Nominees, we agree to appoint to each committee established by the Board such number of Altria Nominees that represents Altria\u2019s proportionate share of the number of directors comprising the applicable Board committee (rounded up to the next whole number) based on the percentage of our issued and outstanding common shares beneficially owned by the Altria Group at the relevant time.Approval RightsThe Investor Rights Agreement also grants Altria, until the Altria Group beneficially owns less than 10% of our issued and outstanding common shares, approval rights over certain transactions that may be undertaken by us. We have agreed that, among other things, we will not (and will use our commercially reasonable efforts to cause our affiliates not to), without the prior written consent of Altria:\u2022consolidate or merge into or with another person or enter into any similar business combination;\u2022acquire any shares or similar equity interests, instruments convertible into or exchangeable for shares or similar equity interests, assets, business or operations with an aggregate value of more than C$100,000,000, in a single transaction or a series of related transactions;\u2022sell, transfer, cause to be transferred, exclusively license, lease, pledge or otherwise dispose of any of our or any of our significant subsidiaries\u2019 assets, business or operations in the aggregate with a value of more than C$60,000,000;\u2022except as required by applicable law, make any changes to our policy with respect to the declaration and payment of any dividends on our common shares;10Table of Contents\u2022subject to certain exceptions, enter into any contract or other agreement, arrangement, or understanding with respect to, or consummate, any transaction or series of related transactions between us or any of our subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any related parties, on the other hand, involving consideration or any other transfer of value required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated pursuant to the Securities Act; or\u2022engage in the production, cultivation, advertisement, marketing, promotion, sale or distribution of cannabis or any Related Products and Services (as defined in the Investor Rights Agreement) in any jurisdiction, including the U.S., where such activity is prohibited by applicable law as of the date of the Investor Rights Agreement (subject to certain limitations).Exclusivity CovenantPursuant to the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement, until the earlier of:\u2022the six-month anniversary of the date on which the Altria Group beneficially owns less than 10% of our issued and outstanding common shares; and\u2022the six-month anniversary of the termination of the Investor Rights Agreement,Altria has agreed to make us its exclusive partner for pursuing cannabis opportunities throughout the world (subject to certain limited exceptions).Pre-Emptive Rights and Top-Up RightsPursuant to the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement and provided the Altria Group continues to beneficially own at least 20% of our issued and outstanding common shares, Altria has a right to purchase, directly or indirectly by another member of the Altria Group, upon the occurrence of certain issuances of common shares by us (including issuances of common shares to Ginkgo under the Ginkgo Collaboration Agreement (each, a \u201cGinkgo Issuance\u201d)) (each, a \u201cTriggering Event\u201d) and subject to obtaining the necessary approvals, up to such number of our common shares issuable in connection with the Triggering Event which will, when added to our common shares beneficially owned by the Altria Group immediately prior to the Triggering Event, result in the Altria Group beneficially owning the same percentage of our issued and outstanding common shares that the Altria Group beneficially owned immediately prior to the Triggering Event (in each case, calculated on a non-diluted basis). The price per common share to be paid by Altria pursuant to the exercise of these pre-emptive rights will be, subject to certain limited exceptions, the same price per common share at which the common shares are sold in the relevant Triggering Event; provided that if the consideration paid in connection with any such issuance is non-cash, the price per common share that would have been received had such common shares been issued for cash consideration will be determined by an independent committee (acting reasonably and in good faith); provided further that the price per common share to be paid by Altria pursuant to the exercise of its pre-emptive rights in connection with a Ginkgo Issuance will be C$16.25 per common share.In addition to (and without duplication of) the aforementioned pre-emptive rights, the Investor Rights Agreement provides Altria with top-up rights, exercisable on a quarterly basis, whereby, subject to obtaining the necessary approvals and for so long as the Altria Group beneficially owns at least 20% of our issued and outstanding common shares, Altria has the right to subscribe for such number of common shares in connection with any Top-Up Securities (as defined below) that we may, from time to time, issue after the date of the Investor Rights Agreement, as will, when added to the common shares beneficially owned by the Altria Group prior to such issuance, result in the Altria Group beneficially owning the same percentage of our issued and outstanding common shares that the Altria Group beneficially owned immediately prior to such issuance. \u201cTop-Up Securities\u201d means any of our common shares issued:\u2022on the exercise, conversion or exchange of our convertible securities issued prior to the date of the Investor Rights Agreement or on the exercise, conversion or exchange of our convertible securities issued after the date of the Investor Rights Agreement in compliance with the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement, in each case, excluding any of our convertible securities owned by any member of the Altria Group;\u2022pursuant to any share incentive plan of the Company;\u2022on the exercise of any right granted by us pro rata to all shareholders to purchase additional common shares and/or other securities of the Company (other than a right issued in a rights offering in which Altria had the right to participate);\u2022in connection with bona fide bank debt, equipment financing or non-equity interim financing transactions with our lenders, in each case, with an equity component; or\u2022in connection with bona fide acquisitions (including acquisitions of assets or rights under a license or otherwise), mergers or similar business combination transactions or joint ventures undertaken and completed by us, in each case, other than (A) common shares issued pursuant to Altria\u2019s pre-emptive right and (B) common shares issued pursuant to the Ginkgo Collaboration Agreement.The price per common share to be paid by Altria pursuant to the exercise of its top-up rights will be, subject to certain limited exceptions, the volume-weighted average price of our common shares on the TSX for the 10 full trading days preceding such exercise by Altria; provided that the price per common share to be paid by Altria pursuant to the exercise of its top-up rights in connection with the issuance of common shares pursuant to the exercise of options or warrants that were outstanding on the date of closing of the Altria Investment will be C$16.25 per common share without any set off, counterclaim, deduction or withholding.11Table of ContentsOpen Market PurchasesThe Altria Group is permitted to acquire our common shares in the open market at any time and in any amount.Registration RightsThe Investor Rights Agreement provides Altria with the right, subject to certain limitations and to the extent permitted by applicable law, to require us to use reasonable commercial efforts to file a prospectus under applicable securities laws and/or a registration statement, qualifying our common shares held by Altria for distribution in Canada and/or the U.S. In addition, the Investor Rights Agreement provides Altria with the right to require us to include our common shares held by Altria in any proposed distribution of common shares in Canada and/or the U.S. by us for our own account.Commercial ArrangementsIn connection with the Altria Investment, we and Altria have entered into certain commercial arrangements (the \u201cCommercial Arrangements\u201d), pursuant to which Altria may provide us with consulting services on matters which may include R&D, marketing, advertising and brand management, government relations and regulatory affairs, finance, tax planning, logistics and other corporate administrative matters.The services under the Commercial Arrangements are provided on customary terms and for a services fee payable by us that is equal to Altria\u2019s reasonably allocated costs plus 5%.Protection of Intangible AssetsThe ownership and protection of our intellectual property rights is a significant aspect of our future success. Currently, we rely on trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets, technical know-how and proprietary information.We seek to protect our intellectual property by strategically seeking and obtaining registered protection where appropriate, developing and implementing standard operating procedures to protect inventions, germplasm, trade secrets, technical know-how and proprietary information and entering into agreements with parties that have access to our inventions, germplasm, trade secrets, technical know-how and proprietary information, such as our partners, collaborators, employees and consultants, to protect confidentiality and ownership.We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our inventions, germplasm, trade secrets, trademarks, technical know-how and proprietary information by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.In addition, we have sought trademark protection in many jurisdictions, including Canada, Australia, the U.S., China, Israel and Europe. Our ability to obtain registered trademark protection for cannabis-related goods and services, in particular for cannabis itself, may be limited in certain countries outside of Canada.For example, in the U.S., registered federal trademark protection is only available for goods and services that can be lawfully used in interstate commerce; the PTO is not currently approving any trademark applications for U.S.Schedule I cannabis, or certain goods containing U.S. hemp-derived CBD (such as dietary supplements and food) until the FDA provides clearer guidance on the regulation of such products.In Europe, trademarks cannot be obtained for products that are \u201ccontrary to public policy or accepted principles of morality.\u201d Accordingly, our ability to obtain intellectual property rights and enforce intellectual property rights against third-party uses of similar trademarks may be limited in certain jurisdictions.Human Capital ResourcesCronos is an innovative global cannabinoid company committed to building disruptive intellectual property by advancing cannabis research, technology and product development.

Different licenses and each sub-class therein carry differing rules and requirements that are intended to be proportional to the public health and safety risks posed by each category and sub-class.Federal RegimeThe Cannabis Act provides a licensing and permitting scheme for, among other things, the cultivation, processing, testing, packaging, labeling, distribution, sale, possession and disposal of adult-use cannabis, implemented by regulations promulgated under the Cannabis Act.The Cannabis Act and Cannabis Regulations include, among other things, strict specifications for the plain packaging and labeling and analytical testing of all cannabis products as well as stringent physical and personnel security requirements for all federally licensed cultivation, processing and sales sites.Health Canada allows license holders to export cannabis products with appropriate export permits. Export permits issued by Health Canada are specific to each shipment and may only be obtained for medical or scientific purposes.To apply for a permit to export cannabis, a license holder must submit significant information to Health Canada including information about the substance to be exported (including description, intended use, quantity) and the importer.As part of the application, applicants are also generally required to provide a copy of the import permit issued by a competent authority in the jurisdiction of final destination and to make a declaration to Health Canada that the shipment does not contravene the laws of the jurisdiction of the final destination or any country of transit or transshipment.The Cannabis Act requires the federal government to conduct a review of the Cannabis Act after three years, which commenced in September 2022. The scope of this statutory review includes, among other things, consideration of (i) the administration and operation of the Cannabis Act, (ii) the impact of the Cannabis Act on public health, (iii) the health and consumption habits of young persons, (iv) the impact of cannabis on indigenous persons and communities and (v) the impact of the cultivation of cannabis plants in a dwelling-house.The federal Minister of Health is expected to table a report in both Houses of Parliament by March 2024.The report resulting from the statutory review may recommend and/or lead to the amendment, removal or addition of provisions in or to the Cannabis Act which could adversely affect our business.13Table of ContentsIn addition to the current medical and adult-use regimes under the Cannabis Act, Health Canada has also been considering the implementation of a cannabis health product regime for products with potential therapeutic uses that would not require practitioner oversight. Between June and September 2019, Health Canada held a public consultation titled \u201cPotential Market for Cannabis Health Products (CHPs) that would not Require Practitioner Oversight.\u201d The consultation sought feedback from Canadians on the kinds of cannabis health products they would be interested in if such products were made available in Canada.A summary report of the consultation results was published by Health Canada in September 2020.Given the results of the consultation, Health Canada has indicated that it intends to obtain external scientific advice on the appropriate evidence standards required to demonstrate safety, efficacy and quality in cannabis health products, with the information it gathers informing the next steps on a potential implementation of a cannabis health product regime. Health Canada intends to engage with key stakeholders further in 2024.In June 2021, Health Canada opened a consultation into the use of flavors in inhaled cannabis extracts as it claims that the availability of flavors is one of the factors that contributes to the increase in cannabis vaping in youth and young adults.As part of this consultation, Health Canada released proposed regulations that contemplate restricting the production, sale, promotion, packaging and labelling of inhaled cannabis extracts from having a flavor, other than the flavor of cannabis.The proposed amendments would apply equally to inhaled cannabis extracts sold for medical and non-medical purposes.The proposed amendments were pre-published in June 2021 and the consultation period closed in September 2021.No expected in-force date has been publicized.In March 2023, Health Canada opened a consultation into potential amendments to the Cannabis Regulations, to streamline and clarify existing requirements; eliminate inefficiencies in the regulations such as duplication between requirements; and reduce administrative and regulatory burden, while continuing to meet the public health and public safety objectives of the Cannabis Act. The consultation closed in May 2023 and Health Canada is reviewing the comments received through the public consultation.The proposed amendments to the Cannabis Regulations are expected to be published in spring 2024 and the consultation period is expected to last 30 days.In December 2023, Health Canada released guidance on cannabis products deliberately made with intoxicating cannabinoids other than delta-9-tetrayhydrocannabinol.Health Canada defines \u201cintoxicating cannabinoids\u201d as cannabinoids that bind to and activate the type 1 cannabinoid receptor (\u201cCB1 receptor\u201d).This guidance recommends that license holders apply the regulatory controls currently applicable to THC to all other cannabinoids that Health Canada defines as \u201cintoxicating cannabinoids\u201d in order to minimize the risks of accidental consumption, overconsumption and adverse effects. Health Canada\u2019s guidance comes at a time when certain provincial cannabis regulators (such as those in Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta) are actively evaluating whether to permit the sale of, or whether to impose limits on the levels of, of certain cannabinoids.Provincial and Territorial DevelopmentsWhile the Cannabis Act provides for the regulation by the Canadian federal government of, among other things, the commercial production of cannabis and the sale of medical cannabis, the various provinces and territories of Canada regulate certain aspects of adult-use cannabis, including the distribution, sale, minimum age requirements and places where cannabis can be consumed.The governments of each Canadian province and territory have implemented regulatory regimes for the distribution and sale of cannabis for adult-use purposes which continue to evolve over time. Most provinces and territories have announced a minimum age for possession and consumption of 19 years old, except for Qu\u00e9bec and Alberta, where the minimum age is 21 and 18, respectively.In addition, provinces and territories may impose additional licensing requirements and restrictions on sales, distribution and promotion which are more stringent than those at the federal level.For example, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Queb\u00e9coise du Cannabis (the \u201cSQDC\u201d), the exclusive distributor of cannabis in the province and the sole retail and online vendor in Qu\u00e9bec, does not permit cannabis vaporizers or other high THC non-edible cannabis products to be sold through its channels.The SQDC has also placed significant restrictions on the types of edibles that may be sold through its channels, prohibiting edibles that are sweet, confectionary, dessert, chocolate or any other product SQDC considers attractive to persons under 21 years of age. Similarly, the Prince Edward Island Cannabis Management Corporation does not allow cannabis vaporizers to be sold through its channels.Provincial distributors may also take different positions on the sale and distribution of products with various cannabinoids (including tetrahydrocannabivarin and cannabinol).Licenses and Regulatory Framework in IsraelIn Israel, cannabis is subject to the Israeli Dangerous Drugs Ordinance [New Version], 5733 \u2013 1973 (the \u201cOrdinance\u201d), and its sale and use are prohibited unless applicable licenses have been obtained.Licenses to cultivate, produce, possess and use cannabis for medical or research purposes in Israel are granted by the Israel Medical Cannabis Agency within the Israeli Ministry of Health (the \u201cYakar\u201d and the \u201cIsraeli MOH,\u201d respectively).Until the Reform Regulations (as described below) take effect, patients must also obtain licenses either directly from physicians who have been authorized to grant patient licenses or from the Yakar following a request from the patient\u2019s physician in order to purchase and consume medical cannabis.14Table of ContentsIn January 2019, the Israeli government approved, in principle, the export from Israel of medical cannabis products that meet applicable quality standards under the strict supervision of the Israeli authorities. Only products that can be directly marketed to patients (including smoking products, oils, and vaporizer products) may be exported, and only to those countries that have signed the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs and that have explicitly approved the import of cannabis.The export of plant substances, including seeds and tissue cultures, is not permitted.In October 2020, the Israeli MOH initiated a pilot program in which certain medical cannabis companies were permitted to export their products, and the Yakar issued guidelines relating to the export of medical cannabis products.These guidelines set forth the process and conditions for obtaining an export license, which can only be issued to an applicant already holding a valid Yakar license.In December 2021, the Director General of the Israeli MOH announced the appointment of a committee (the \u201cCBD Committee\u201d) intended to examine the possibility of excluding CBD from being considered a \u201cdangerous drug\u201d under the Ordinance. In February 2022, the CBD Committee published its recommendations.The CBD Committee concluded that it would be advisable to exclude CBD from the Ordinance and to allow CBD use, other than in food and cosmetics products, provided that the aggregate concentration of THC does not exceed 0.2%.The CBD Committee further recommended that during the next two years, CBD components not be approved as a component in food, food supplements, and cosmetics and that this issue be re-examined by a committee designated by the Israeli MOH.In March 2022, the Israeli MOH adopted the conclusions of the CBD Committee and published a draft order for public comments which excludes CBD from the Ordinance while setting the threshold of aggregate concentration of THC (or any structural derivative of THC) in any product, at 0.3%. Cosmetics and food products would be handled by specific regulations in such fields.As of January 2024, no final order was issued, and CBD has yet to be excluded from the Ordinance.On January 31, 2022, the Economic Affairs Committee of the Israeli Parliament held a discussion regarding the adverse effect on the local cannabis industry of significant import of medical cannabis.The discussion was concluded with a request to the Israeli MOH to study the matter and consider banning medical cannabis import until a balance is reached in the market between the import and export of medical cannabis.The Israeli MOH has not yet publicly issued a study on the matter.In July 2022, a committee appointed by the Director General of the Israeli MOH concluded that it would be advisable to reform the medical cannabis regulatory framework by transitioning from the grant of personal patient licenses to the issuance of prescriptions available through public healthcare services. In August 2022, the new regulations adopting this reform (the \u201cReform Regulations\u201d) were presented for public comments.The Reform Regulations propose to amend the Ordinance to allow medical cannabis to be prescribed by trained and certified physicians and to be held and distributed by pharmacies.The Reform Regulations aim to ease the Yakar\u2019s regulations relating to medical cannabis prescriptions and accelerate research and innovation in the field.The Reform Regulations were approved by the Israeli Parliament\u2019s health committee in June 2023, and published in July 2023.The Reform Regulations were expected to enter into effect in December 2023, however, due to the situation in Israel and the Israel-Hamas War, its entrance into effect was postponed until March 29, 2024.On December 31, 2023, the Israeli MOH published proposed changes to the current directives and guidelines of the Yakar and Israeli MOH, which remained open for public comments until January 21, 2024.In June 2022, 11 cannabis manufacturers (including Cronos Israel G.S Manufacturing Ltd.) (the \u201cPetitioners\u201d) filed an administrative petition to the District Court in Jerusalem regarding the Yakar\u2019s decision to issue a constructive license (i.e., a license for dealing with medical cannabis, without a direct contact with the drug, such as brokering medical cannabis transactions) (the \u201cConstructive License\u201d). The Petitioners claim that the procedure and requirements for other licenses (e.g., for cultivation or production), granted by the Yakar, are unreasonably more stringent than those of the Constructive License.On January 5, 2023, the District Court in Jerusalem ordered the Israeli MOH to stop the issuance of Constructive Licenses for 60 days, and to formulate a clear policy regarding the issuance of such Constructive Licenses.On February 12, 2023, the director general of the Yakar published a decision regarding the Constructive Licenses, in response to the District Court\u2019s order.The decision clarifies the Yakar\u2019s authority to grant Constructive Licenses for the import/export of medical cannabis.On August 30, 2023, following recommendation by the Israeli MOH\u2019s committee, the Director General of the Israeli MOH appointed an additional committee (the \u201c2023 Committee\u201d). The 2023 Committee\u2019s mandate is to comprehensively examine which cannabinoids and parts of the cannabis plant have a psychoactive-addictive effect and whether the classification of cannabis as a \u201cdangerous drug\u201d under the Ordinance is warranted.In September 2023, the Israeli MOH sought public comments and input about the 2023 Committee\u2019s subject matter.The 2023 Committee was scheduled to publish its recommendations by January 1, 2024, but to date, has not done so.Cronos Israel LicensesCronos Israel maintains the following certificates and corresponding permits: (1) full Good Agricultural Practices (\u201cGAP\u201d) certification, including a permit to propagate and cultivate at the full capacity of the greenhouse; and (2) Good Manufacturing Practices (\u201cGMP\u201d) and Good Distribution Practices (\u201cGDP\u201d) certificates and permits to produce and distribute dried flower, cannabis oils and pre-rolls.Licenses and Regulatory Framework in Other JurisdictionsWe and our joint venture partners, strategic investments and strategic partners are subject to comprehensive and evolving regulations in each jurisdiction in which we and they operate. All aspects of the production, manufacture and distribution of cannabis products are15Table of Contentsregulated and subject to licensing regimes.These regulations and licensing regimes vary by jurisdiction and we, our joint venture partners, strategic investments and strategic partners spend significant time, effort and money to comply with the applicable requirements.We seek to comply with export laws in connection with distributing our products in other jurisdictions by obtaining export permits from Health Canada.Our strategic partners are responsible for compliance with import laws and local regulatory requirements (including laws related to distribution of medical products) in jurisdictions in which they operate.Available InformationWe are subject to the informational requirements of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), and, in accordance with the Exchange Act, we also file reports with and furnish other information to the SEC.

Any of the matters highlighted in these risk factors could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, causing an investor to lose all, or part of, its, his or her investment.The risks and uncertainties described below are those we currently believe to be material, but they are not the only ones we face.If any of the following risks, or any other risks and uncertainties that we have not yet identified or that we currently consider not to be material, actually occur or become material risks, our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and consequently the price of our securities could be materially and adversely affected.Risk Factor Summary\u2022Certain of our subsidiaries and joint ventures have limited operating histories and our growth strategy may not be successful.\u2022We may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability and may continue to incur losses in the future.\u2022Our products are new; there is limited long-term data with respect to the effects and the safety of our products, which is subject to conflicting medical data; and our products have been and may be in the future subject to recalls.\u2022The production and distribution of our products is subject to disruption, the risks of an agricultural business and the risk third-party suppliers and distributors may not perform their obligations to us.\u2022Intellectual property is key to our growth strategy, and we may be unable to obtain or enforce our intellectual property rights.\u2022Our entry into new markets is subject to risks normally associated with the conduct of business in foreign countries.\u2022We are subject to extensive regulation and licensing and may not successfully comply with all applicable laws and regulations.\u2022Our businesses face highly competitive conditions.\u2022Altria has significant influence over us.\u2022The price of our common shares has been and may continue to be highly volatile.16Table of Contents\u2022We have had two restatements and seven material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting over the last five years.\u2022We are subject to other risks generally applicable to our industry and the conduct of our businesses.Risks Relating to Our Growth Strategy.We have a limited operating history and therefore we are subject to many of the risks common to early-stage enterprises.We began carrying on business in 2013 and generated our first revenues in 2013. In addition, many of our joint ventures are in the early stages of their operations and have generated little or no revenue.We are therefore subject to many of the risks common to early-stage enterprises, including limitations with respect to personnel, financial, and other resources and lack of revenues.We may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability and may continue to incur losses in the future.We have incurred significant losses in recent periods and have negative operating cash flow for the last five fiscal years.We may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability and may continue to incur significant losses in the future even in light of our Realignment, the pending sale-leaseback transaction and change in the nature of operations at the Peace Naturals Campus, the exit of our U.S. operations and the wind-down and exit of our operations at Cronos Fermentation. In addition, we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses as we implement initiatives to continue to grow our business.If our revenues do not increase to offset these expected costs and operating expenses, we will not be profitable.If our revenue declines or fails to grow at a rate faster than our operating expenses, we will not be able to achieve and maintain profitability in future periods.As a result, we may continue to generate losses.We may not achieve profitability in the future and, even if we do become profitable, we might not be able to sustain that profitability.We may not be able to successfully manage our growth.We are currently in an early development stage and may be subject to growth-related risks, including capacity constraints and pressure on our internal systems and controls, which may place significant strain on our operational and managerial resources. While our revenue has generally grown in recent years, our ability to manage and sustain revenue growth will depend on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to, changes in laws and regulations respecting the production of U.S. hemp and cannabis products, competition from other license holders, the size of the illegal market and the adult-use market in Canada, and our ability to produce sufficient volumes of our products to meet customer demand.Our ability to manage growth effectively will require us to continue to implement and improve our operational and financial systems and to expand, train and manage our employee base.There can be no assurances that we will be able to manage growth successfully.Any inability to manage growth successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our use of joint ventures may expose us to risks associated with jointly owned investments.We currently operate parts of our business through joint ventures with other companies, and we may enter into additional joint ventures and strategic alliances in the future. Joint venture investments may involve risks not otherwise present for investments made solely by us, including: (i) we may not control the joint ventures, either by virtue of our economic or legal ownership share, or our ability to influence day-to-day operational decision-making; (ii) our joint venture partners may not agree to distributions that we believe are appropriate; (iii) where we do not have substantial decision-making authority, we may experience impasses or disputes with our joint venture partners on certain decisions, which could require us to expend additional resources to resolve such impasses or disputes, including litigation or arbitration; (iv) our joint venture partners may become insolvent or bankrupt, fail to fund their share of required capital contributions or fail to fulfill their obligations as a joint venture partner; (v) the arrangements governing our joint ventures may contain certain conditions or milestone events that may never be satisfied or achieved; (vi) our joint venture partners may have business or economic interests that are inconsistent with ours and may take actions contrary to our interests; (vii) we may suffer losses as a result of actions taken by our joint venture partners with respect to our joint venture investments; (viii) it may be difficult for us to exit a joint venture if an impasse arises or if we desire to sell our interest for any reason; (ix) our joint venture partners may exercise termination rights under the relevant agreements and (x) conflicts of interest may arise between our joint ventures and Company personnel who are directors of our joint ventures because of the fact that such directors are employed by us. In addition, we may, in certain circumstances, be liable for the actions of our joint ventures or joint venture partners.Any of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and the magnitude of these material adverse effects could be greater to the extent we decide to rely on such joint ventures for certain goods or services, such as the receipt of raw materials from Cronos GrowCo, or decide to outsource certain operating activities to such joint ventures.17Table of ContentsThere can be no assurance of continued growth in Israel and our performance in Israel depends on, among other things, our ability to continue to import cannabis into Israel and our joint venture partners.While our revenue in Israel has experienced periods of significant growth, our prior performance is not indicative of any potential future results in Israel. The Israel-Hamas War has created significant uncertainty with respect to our operations in Israel and may materially and adversely affect our sales and other activities in Israel.There can be no assurance that our growth in the Israeli market can be sustained or will continue.Our ability to manage and sustain revenue growth in Israel will depend on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to, the impact of, and developments in, the Israel-Hamas War on our operations, our ability to continue to import cannabis into Israel (including the outcome of the anti-dumping investigation initiated by the Israel Ministry of Economy and Industry, see Part II, Note 10 \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further details), changes in laws and regulations respecting the cultivation, production, marketing and sale of dried flower, pre-rolls and oils in Israel, growth of the medical cannabis patient count in Israel, increased competition, our ability to produce sufficient volumes of our products to meet customer demand and our ability to maintain or grow our market share in Israel. Any of these factors could materially and negatively impact our growth in Israel.We have begun to further leverage our strategic joint venture with Cronos GrowCo.Our winddown of the cultivation and certain production activities at the Peace Naturals Campus as well as the previously-announced sale-leaseback of the Peace Naturals Campus and the Company\u2019s intention to pursue a sale of Cronos Fermentation have increased the importance of Cronos GrowCo to our business and operations.Cronos GrowCo\u2019s production facilities are our principal source of raw materials.Therefore, our performance in Israel is reliant on our ability to acquire such raw materials on a timely and cost-effective basis from Cronos GrowCo and to continue to import such raw materials and cannabis products to Israel from Cronos GrowCo\u2019s production facilities. There is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully execute our strategy to expand production at Cronos GrowCo or that we will be able to obtain the regulatory approvals, licenses and permits required for both the export of cannabis from Canada and the import of cannabis into Israel.Further, there can be no assurance that the anti-dumping investigation initiated by the Israel Ministry of Economy and Industry will not result in the imposition of an anti-dumping duty on us or limit our imports into Israel, the impact of which could have a material adverse effect on our business in Israel.Our acquisition strategy may not be successful, and we have in the past, and may in the future, need to write down the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets recognized upon the acquisitions.In the second quarter of 2021, we wrote off all of the goodwill and substantially all of the indefinite-lived intangible assets recognized upon the acquisition of Redwood and in the second quarter of 2023, we announced plans to cease our U.S. hemp operations. Acquisitions of companies or equity interests of companies operating in new markets are risky and speculative and may not produce the anticipated revenues and profits.Our acquisition of the PharmaCann Option (the \u201cPharmaCann Investment\u201d) presents significant risks.See \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Risks Relating to Our Growth Strategy\u2014Our U.S. strategy in part depends on the success of the PharmaCann Investment and there is no guarantee that we will exercise the PharmaCann Option in the near term, or at all, and, even if exercised, that the PharmaCann Investment will achieve the expected benefits of the transaction.\u201dWe have had two restatements and seven material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting over the last five years.We had a material weakness in our control environment, and in 2021 and 2022, we experienced significant turnover, both voluntary and involuntary, in our accounting and financial reporting functions, as well as in our internal audit function. If we are unable to create and maintain an appropriate control environment, our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and reputation will be adversely affected.Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) and for evaluating and reporting on the effectiveness of our system of internal control.Effective internal control is necessary for us to provide timely, reliable and accurate financial reports, identify and proactively correct any deficiencies, material weaknesses or fraud and meet our reporting obligations.We had two restatements and seven material weaknesses in the last five years and have had significant turnover, both voluntary and involuntary, in our accounting and financial reporting functions as well as in our internal audit function. Moreover, we had a material weakness in our control environment existing as of December 31, 2022.Remediation efforts have placed, and will continue to place, a significant burden on management and add increased pressure on our financial reporting resources and processes.The accuracy of our financial reporting and our ability to timely file with the SEC and the applicable securities regulatory authorities in Canada have in the past been, and may in the future be, adversely impacted if any additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting are identified.In addition, if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control occur in the future, we could be required to restate our financial statements again, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, restrict our ability to access the capital markets, require us to expend significant resources to correct the material weaknesses, subject us to regulatory investigations and penalties, harm our reputation, cause a decline in investor confidence or otherwise cause a decline in our stock price.We are subject to civil litigation relating to the restatements and we cannot predict the outcome of this litigation, but we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs and expenses in defending against this civil litigation. For more information on this18Table of Contentscivil litigation and proceedings, see Part II, Note 10(b) \u201cContingencies\u201d to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report.We are subject to disabilities as a result of our settlement with the SEC that may expose us to increased future litigation and adversely affect our ability to raise capital.As of the date of our settlement with the SEC (the \u201cSEC Order\u201d), October 24, 2022, and for a period of three years thereafter, we are unable to rely on the safe harbor provisions regarding forward-looking statements provided by the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.Our inability to rely on these safe harbor provisions may expose us to increased future litigation in connection with forward-looking statements in our public disclosures.Further, as of the date of the SEC Order, we have lost our status as a \u201cwell-known seasoned issuer\u201d for a period of three years, which places limitations on the manner in which we can market our securities to the public, and we are unable to rely on the private offering exemptions provided by Regulations A and D under the Securities Act for a period of five years, which could impair our ability to raise additional capital in the private market quickly in response to changing requirements and market conditions.There can be no assurance that our current and future strategic alliances or expansions of scope of existing relationships will have a beneficial impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We currently have, and may in the future enter into additional, strategic alliances with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our existing business. Our ability to complete strategic alliances is dependent upon, and may be limited by, the availability of suitable candidates and capital.In addition, strategic alliances could present unforeseen integration or operational obstacles or costs, may not enhance our business and may involve risks that could adversely affect us, including significant amounts of management time that may be diverted from operations in order to pursue and complete such transactions or maintain such strategic alliances.Future strategic alliances could result in the incurrence of debt, costs and contingent liabilities, and there can be no assurance that future strategic alliances will achieve, or that our existing strategic alliances will achieve, the expected benefits to our business or that we will be able to consummate future strategic alliances on satisfactory terms, or at all. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.In the case of the Ginkgo Strategic Partnership, we have and will continue to obtain, pursuant to the Ginkgo Collaboration Agreement, the exclusive right to use and commercialize the key patented intellectual property related to the production of the target cannabinoids globally (referred to herein as the \u201cGinkgo exclusive licenses\u201d).There can be no assurance that Ginkgo will be able to develop microorganisms that we will be able to commercialize or to obtain patents relating to production of the target cannabinoids, or that third parties will not develop similar microorganisms or obtain patents that may restrict our ability to commercialize the microorganisms developed by Ginkgo, and, as a result, there can be no assurance that we will be able to realize the expected benefits of the Ginkgo Strategic Partnership. Additionally, we have determined, and may determine in the future, that the production of certain cannabinoids is not economically feasible and in our best interests and we have abandoned, and may abandon in the future, the production efforts of Ginkgo with respect to certain target cannabinoids.Even if we are able to commercialize cultured cannabinoids, we may not be able to generate satisfactory returns on them or on the products that incorporate them, and there may not be demand for such cultured cannabinoid products.In addition, pursuant to the Ginkgo Collaboration Agreement, if we undergo a change of control that is approved by the Board, Ginkgo may elect to receive cash payments, which, given the number of Equity Milestone Events (as defined in the Ginkgo Collaboration Agreement) that have occurred to date, could total up to $15.8 million, in lieu of the common shares that would otherwise become issuable in connection with any Equity Milestone Events achieved following such election (the \u201cMilestone Cash Election\u201d). If we undergo a change in control that has not been approved by the Board, then Ginkgo will have the ability to terminate the Ginkgo Collaboration Agreement immediately, in which case, among other things: (i) all rights or licenses granted to us by Ginkgo under the Ginkgo Collaboration Agreement will terminate; (ii) certain expenses and costs incurred by Ginkgo will be accelerated and become due and payable by us; (iii) the then-outstanding and unpaid portion of all cash payments from us to Ginkgo for the achievement of R&D milestones by Ginkgo shall be due immediately as if all R&D milestones had been achieved; and (iv) a lump sum cash payment equal to the aggregate of all Milestone Cash Election amounts in respect of which the relevant Equity Milestone Events have not yet been achieved will be immediately due and payable by us. In addition, should Ginkgo terminate the Ginkgo Collaboration Agreement upon a change of control, we will no longer be able to use or commercialize the key patented intellectual property related to the production of the target cannabinoids, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.See \u201cDescription of Business\u2014Research and Development Activities and Intellectual Property.\u201dAs additional equity milestones occur under the Ginkgo Collaboration Agreement, we are required by accounting rules to conduct an impairment analysis related to the new Ginkgo exclusive licenses.These analyses have resulted in impairment charges in the past and may do so in the future as additional equity milestones are achieved.For a discussion of our most recent impairments of the Ginkgo exclusive licenses, see Note 7 \u201cGoodwill and Intangible Assets, net\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.19Table of ContentsWe may not successfully execute our production capacity strategy.We may not be successful in executing our strategy to expand production capacity at certain of our facilities and joint ventures and wind down of cultivation and certain production activities at the Peace Naturals Campus. Continuing and expanding operations at our facilities and joint ventures will be subject to obtaining and maintaining the appropriate licenses from the relevant regulatory agencies in those jurisdictions.In particular, continuing and expanding operations at Cronos GrowCo\u2019s production facilities will be subject to obtaining and maintaining the appropriate licenses from Health Canada.Construction delays or cost over-runs in respect of such operations, howsoever caused, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Moreover, with the pending sale-leaseback transaction and change in the nature of operations at the Peace Naturals Campus, the continued operations of the Cronos GrowCo production facilities will be more important to us.Additionally, we must obtain approval from Health Canada for changes to our site perimeter on the Peace Naturals Campus prior to closing the sale-leaseback transaction and there can be no assurance as to whether or when we might obtain such approval. Cronos GrowCo\u2019s production facilities are our principal source of raw materials.In addition, we may not be successful in obtaining the necessary approvals required to export or import our products to or from the jurisdictions in which we or our joint ventures operate.If we are unable to secure necessary production licenses in respect of our facilities and those of our joint ventures, the expectations of management with respect to the increased future cultivation and growing capacity may not be borne out, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may not be able to successfully procure rare cannabinoids at commercially viable prices or in the quantities that we require.As a result of our decision to wind down Cronos Fermentation, we no longer have the internal capacity to produce rare cannabinoids through the fermentation process developed with Ginkgo. To the extent we continue to utilize rare cannabinoids in our products, we may be required to engage third-party suppliers to obtain rights to new extraction methods or may be required to purchase rare cannabinoids in the open market.We may not be able to find third-party suppliers capable of producing rare cannabinoids at commercially viable prices or in the quantities we require.If we are unable to secure the necessary rare cannabinoids, we may experience product shortages and delays and we may be unable to launch new products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.There can be no assurance that the Realignment, the pending sale-leaseback and the change in the nature of operations at the Peace Naturals Campus, the exit of our U.S. operations and the wind-down and exit of our Cronos Fermentation facility will have a beneficial impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The timing, costs and benefits thereof cannot be guaranteed.In the first quarter of 2022, we announced our Realignment to centralize functions under common leadership to increase efficient distribution of resources, improve strategic alignment and eliminate duplication of roles and costs; evaluate our global supply chain and perform product reviews and pricing and distribution optimization in order to reduce fixed expenses and reduce complexity; and implement an operating expense target to optimize cash deployment for activities such as margin accretive innovation and U.S. adult-use cannabis market entry in the future.Additionally, we announced a plan to leverage our strategic partnerships to improve supply chain efficiencies and reduce manufacturing overhead by partially exiting the Peace Naturals Campus. We subsequently decided to retain certain distribution, warehousing, R&D and manufacturing operations at the Peace Naturals Campus.In the second quarter of 2023, we announced the exit of our U.S. operations.In the third quarter of 2023, we announced the wind-down and exit of our Cronos Fermentation facility.There can be no assurance that these initiatives will achieve the expected benefits to our business or reduce costs or grow our revenue as intended and, if achieved at all, the timing thereof.The execution and implementation of these initiatives involve risk, including that significant amounts of management\u2019s time and Company resources could be diverted from our core operations in order to complete such initiatives.Some risks, such as obtaining approval from Health Canada for changes to our site perimeter on the Peace Naturals Campus, are outside of our control. In addition, these initiatives could present unforeseen obstacles, lead to operating inefficiencies and negatively disrupt our corporate culture, which could lead to further employee attrition, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We have and will continue to incur costs to implement these initiatives, and we could be subject to litigation risks and expenses.Our projected costs and expenses associated with the changes in operations described above may turn out to be too low by a material amount.There can be no assurance that the regulatory approvals will be obtained or that the other closing conditions for the sale and leaseback of the Peace Naturals Campus will be satisfied or waived in a timely manner or at all.Pursuant to the Sale Agreement, Future Farmco has agreed to acquire the Peace Naturals Campus subject to certain conditions. These conditions include, among other things, Future Farmco and the Company agreeing on the form of a lease, confirmation from Future Farmco that it has secured financing for the transaction and the Company receiving approval from Health Canada for site perimeter changes, each as set forth in the Sale Agreement.There can be no assurance that such closing conditions will be satisfied or waived or that the Company will obtain approval from Health Canada on commercially reasonable terms, in a timely manner, or at all, or that the20Table of Contentssale and leaseback of the Peace Naturals Campus will be completed.Additionally, there can be no assurance that the sale and leaseback of the Peace Naturals Campus will occur on the terms and conditions described herein or previously announced.We may not be able to realize the expected cost-savings and other benefits related to the wind-down of operations at the Cronos Fermentation facility.In the third quarter of 2023, we announced the decision to wind down operations at the Cronos Fermentation facility, list the Cronos Fermentation facility for sale, and implement additional organization-wide cost reductions as we continue our Realignment initiatives. There can be no assurance that we will be able to sell the Cronos Fermentation facility within an acceptable time frame and for an acceptable price or that these initiatives will achieve the expected benefits to our business within our expected time frame.The execution and implementation of these initiatives involve risk, including that significant amounts of management\u2019s time and Company resources could be diverted from our core operations in order to complete such initiatives.In addition, these initiatives could present unforeseen obstacles, lead to operating inefficiencies and negatively disrupt our corporate culture, which could lead to further employee attrition, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We have and will continue to incur costs to implement these initiatives, and we could be subject to litigation.The industries and markets in which we operate are relatively new, and these industries and markets may not continue to exist or grow as anticipated or we may ultimately be unable to succeed in these industries and markets.The medical and adult-use cannabis industries and markets in which we operate are relatively new, are highly speculative, are rapidly expanding and may ultimately not be successful. In addition to being subject to general business risks, we need to continue to build brand awareness in these industries and markets through significant investments in our strategy, our production capacity, quality assurance and compliance with regulations.These activities may not promote our brand and products as effectively as intended, or at all.Competitive conditions and consumer tastes, as applicable, and spending patterns in these new industries and markets are relatively unknown and may have unique circumstances that differ from existing industries and markets.We are subject to all of the business risks associated with a new business in a niche market, including risks of unforeseen capital requirements, failure of widespread market acceptance of our products, failure to establish business relationships and competitive disadvantages against larger and more established competitors.Accordingly, there are no assurances that these industries and markets will continue to exist or grow as currently estimated or anticipated, or function and evolve in a manner consistent with management\u2019s expectations and assumptions, and a failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may not be able to supply the purchasers in various provinces and territories of Canada with our products in the quantities or prices anticipated, or at all.We have entered into supply arrangements for cannabis products with various provincial and territorial purchasers and have secured listings with private retailers in certain provinces. We have entered into such supply arrangements with all provinces in Canada (where the relevant provincial body is the sole wholesale distributor of cannabis products in the province) and the Yukon Territory and with private retailers in Saskatchewan.Our supply arrangements with provincial and territorial purchasers do not contain any binding minimum purchase obligations on the part of the relevant provincial or territorial purchaser.We expect purchase orders to be primarily driven by end-consumer demand for our products and the relevant provincial, territorial or private purchaser supply at the relevant time.Accordingly, we cannot predict the quantities of our products that will be purchased by the provincial, territorial and private purchasers, or if our products will be purchased at all.Provincial and territorial purchasers may change the terms of the supply agreements at any time during the supply relationship including pricing, have broad rights of return of products and are under no obligation to purchase our products or maintain any listings of our products for sale. As a result, provincial and territorial purchasers have a significant amount of control over the terms of the supply arrangements.Furthermore, provincial and territorial purchasers may also decide to ban, limit or implement new guidance on the types of cannabis products permitted for sale in each of their jurisdictions (including in response to Health Canada\u2019s guidance on intoxicating cannabinoids) which may result in some or all of our products being viewed as non-compliant with law or non-binding policy guidance.The adult-use cannabis market in Canada has in the past been and may in the future become oversupplied.Numerous additional cannabis producers have and may continue to enter the Canadian adult-use market.We and such other cannabis producers have in the past produced and may in the future produce more cannabis than is needed to satisfy the collective demand of the Canadian medical and adult-use markets, and we may be unable to export that over-supply into other markets. As a result, the available supply of cannabis could exceed demand, which has in the past, and may in the future, result in significant inventory write downs and decreases in market prices.21Table of ContentsWe may be unsuccessful in competing in the legal adult-use cannabis market in Canada.We face competition from existing license holders licensed under the Cannabis Act.Certain of these competitors may have significantly greater financial, production, marketing, R&D and technical and human resources than we do.As a result, our competitors may be more successful than us in gaining market share in the adult-use cannabis industry in Canada.Our commercial opportunity in the adult-use market could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors produce and commercialize products for the adult-use market that, among other things, are safer, more effective, more convenient or less expensive than the products that we may produce, have greater sales, marketing and distribution support than our products, enjoy enhanced timing of market introduction and perceived effectiveness advantages over our products and receive more favorable publicity than our products. If our adult-use products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by the adult-use market, we may not generate sufficient revenue from these products, and our adult-use business may not become profitable.We are subject to liability arising from any fraudulent or illegal activity by our employees, contractors, manufacturers and consultants.We are exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, manufacturers and consultants may engage in fraudulent or other illegal activity.Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or engaging in unauthorized activities that violate: (i) applicable laws and regulations; (ii) manufacturing standards; (iii) federal and provincial healthcare fraud and abuse of federal, state and provincial laws and regulations; or (iv) laws and regulations that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. It is not always possible for us to identify and deter misconduct by our employees and other third parties, and the precautions taken by us to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with such laws or regulations.If any such actions are brought against us, and we are not successful in defending them, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, loss or suspension of licenses and the curtailment of our operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Some jurisdictions may never develop markets for cannabis and U.S. hemp.Many jurisdictions place restrictions on or prohibit commercial activities involving cannabis and U.S. hemp. Such restrictions or prohibitions may make it impossible or impractical for us to enter or expand our operations in such jurisdictions unless there is a change in law or regulation.For example, U.S.Schedule I cannabis remains illegal under U.S. federal law and may never become legal under U.S. federal law.Our U.S. strategy in part depends on the success of the PharmaCann Investment and there is no guarantee that we will exercise the PharmaCann Option in the near term, or at all, and, even if exercised, that the PharmaCann Investment will achieve the expected benefits of the transaction.Our ability to exercise the PharmaCann Option will depend on the satisfaction of several conditions, including U.S. federal cannabis legalization.In addition, our ability to exercise the PharmaCann Option is subject to the receipt of any required regulatory approvals, including in the states where PharmaCann operates that may be required upon exercise, as well as Altria\u2019s approval under the Investor Rights Agreement. These conditions are outside of our control and therefore there can be no certainty that the PharmaCann Option will be exercised in the near term, or at all.If the PharmaCann Option is not exercised, we will not receive the benefits of the contemplated commercial arrangements between us and PharmaCann.In addition, the regulatory approval processes in connection with the exercise of the PharmaCann Option may take a prolonged period of time to complete, which could significantly delay our ability to exercise the PharmaCann Option and realize the benefits of the PharmaCann Investment, or result in our not being able to exercise all or part of the PharmaCann Option.Furthermore, in connection with obtaining approvals from or otherwise satisfying the requests of the state regulators or applicable laws, we may be required to divest all or a portion of the PharmaCann Option, or if after the exercise of the PharmaCann Option, our shares of PharmaCann.Even if we are able to and do exercise the PharmaCann Option, the intended benefits of the PharmaCann Investment may not be realized. We cannot assure you that the PharmaCann Investment will be accretive to us in the near term or at all.For example, if entered into, the commercial arrangements between us and PharmaCann may not be successful or beneficial to us.Furthermore, if we fail to realize the intended benefits of the PharmaCann Investment, our stock price could decline to the extent that the market price anticipates those benefits.We are entitled to certain limited governance rights with respect to PharmaCann, including limited information rights and board observer rights.Therefore, we will have little to no ability to influence the strategy and material decisions of PharmaCann\u2019s business.Furthermore, until such time as we exercise the PharmaCann Option, we will not have the ability to vote on matters requiring the vote of PharmaCann\u2019s shareholders. In addition, we are subject to certain standstill restrictions, both prior to and after the exercise of the PharmaCann Option, which restrictions further limit our ability to influence decisions of PharmaCann.22Table of ContentsAlthough we are entitled to certain anti-dilution protections with respect to our investment in PharmaCann, such protections are subject to various conditions, and our potential ownership in PharmaCann may be significantly diluted by, among other things, future issuances of PharmaCann securities or acquisition activity in which PharmaCann uses its equity as consideration.As of December 31, 2023, the Company\u2019s ownership percentage in PharmaCann on a fully diluted basis was approximately 5.9%.Under the terms of our investment in PharmaCann, Cronos\u2019 rights to nominate an observer to the PharmaCann board of directors could be lost if our ownership drops below 6% on a fully diluted basis and we sell or transfer all or any portion of the PharmaCann Option (subject to certain exceptions).We must rely largely on our own market research to forecast sales and market demand and market prices may differ from our forecasts.We must rely largely on our own market research and internal data to forecast sales as detailed market data is not generally obtainable from other sources at this early stage of the cannabis industry. If our sales forecasts and our expectations regarding market conditions, including prices, influence capital expenditure levels, inventory levels, production and supply chain capacity and operating expenses, prove to be inaccurate, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.For example, our forecasts for product demand and market conditions were impacted by a decline in market prices for cannabis products in the Canadian market, which contributed to our inventory write-down in the second and fourth quarters of 2020.We could have difficulty integrating the operations of businesses that we have acquired and will acquire.The success of our acquisitions depends upon our ability to integrate any businesses that we acquire.The integration of acquired business operations could disrupt our business by causing unforeseen operating difficulties, diverting management\u2019s attention from day-to-day operations and requiring significant financial resources that would otherwise be used for the ongoing development of our business. The difficulties of integrations could be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically dispersed organizations, coordinating personnel with disparate business backgrounds, managing different corporate cultures, or discovering previously unknown liabilities.In addition, we could be unable to retain key employees or customers of the acquired businesses.We could face integration issues including those related to operations, internal control and information systems and operational functions of the acquired companies and we also could fail to realize cost efficiencies or synergies that we anticipated when selecting our acquisition candidates or these acquisitions could fail to compete successfully.Any of these items could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For more information on the risks associated with acquisitions, see \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Risks Relating to Our Growth Strategy\u2014Our acquisition strategy may not be successful and we have in the past, and may in the future, need to write down the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets recognized upon the acquisitions.\u201dWe have been and may in the future be required to write down intangible assets, including goodwill, due to impairment, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.The Company has been and may in the future be required to write down intangible assets, including goodwill, due to impairment, which would reduce earnings.Indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed annually or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets have been reduced to less than their carrying amount. We periodically calculate the fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets to test for impairment.This calculation may be affected by several factors, including general economic conditions, regulatory developments, changes in category growth rates as a result of changing adult consumer preferences, success of planned new product introductions, and competitive activity.Certain events can also trigger an immediate review of goodwill and intangible assets.If the carrying amount of our reporting unit and other intangible assets exceed their fair value, the goodwill and other intangible assets are considered impaired, which would result in impairment losses and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.For a discussion of previous write downs of indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, see Note 7 \u201cGoodwill and Intangible Assets, net\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.Risks Relating to Operations in IsraelConditions in Israel could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.We have operations in Israel through a strategic joint venture, Cronos Israel.On October 7, 2023, Hamas terrorists from the Gaza Strip launched a rocket barrage against Israel and engaged in incursions into Israeli territory, breaching the Gaza-Israel border, attacking military bases and slaughtering and kidnapping civilians in neighboring Israeli communities. Israel formally declared war on October 8.The Israel-Hamas War may further escalate, including due to an eruption of fighting between Hezbollah and Israel across Israel\u2019s northern border, which would open a second front in the war, and may result in a broader conflict across the Middle East.The Israel-Hamas War (and any escalation) and any resulting regional political instability or interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its trading partners would likely materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.On October 8, 2023, the Yakar issued guidelines for maintaining the business continuity in the field of medical cannabis, in light of the national effort relating to the Israel-Hamas War.Such guidelines include extensions of patient licenses and business licenses.23Table of ContentsOur employees, including certain members of our management, operate from our offices located in Gan Shmuel, Israel and our manufacturing facilities located in Hadera, Israel. While our facilities have not been damaged by the war, rocket attacks continue, and our facilities could be damaged or destroyed.Imports into Israel have been severely affected by the war, and we may be unable to import materials into Israel.Further, our sales have been, and likely will continue to be, adversely affected by the war.Our commercial insurance does not cover losses that may occur as a result of events associated with war and terrorism.Any losses or damage incurred by us could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Further, in the past, the State of Israel and Israeli companies have been subjected to economic boycotts.Several countries still restrict doing business with the State of Israel and with Israeli companies.A campaign of boycotts, divestment, and sanctions has been undertaken against Israel, which could also adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations and the expansion of our business.Our operations may be disrupted by the obligations of personnel to perform military service.Some of our employees in Israel are obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the Israeli military for several days, and in some cases more, of annual military reserve duty each year until they reach the age of 40 (or older, for reservists who are military officers or who have certain occupations) and are subject to being called for additional active duty under emergency circumstances. In response to the Israel-Hamas War, a number of our employees have been called up to serve in the Israeli military.We cannot predict the full impact of these conditions on us in the future, particularly if emergency circumstances or an escalation in the political or military situation occurs.If many of our employees are called for active duty, our operations in Israel and our business may not be able to function at profitable levels, or at all, and our business in, results of operations from, Israel would be adversely affected.Risks Relating to Our ProductsThere is limited long-term data with respect to the efficacy and side effects of cannabis, U.S. hemp and cannabinoids, and future clinical research studies on the effects of cannabis, U.S. hemp and cannabinoids may lead to conclusions that dispute or conflict with our understanding and belief regarding their benefits, viability, safety, efficacy, dosing and social acceptance.Research in Canada, the U.S. and internationally regarding the benefits, viability, safety, efficacy, dosing and social acceptance of cannabis, U.S. hemp or isolated cannabinoids (such as CBD and THC) inhaled, in dietary supplements, food, or cosmetic products remains in early stages. There have been relatively few clinical trials on the potential benefits of cannabis, U.S. hemp or isolated cannabinoids in dietary supplements, food, or cosmetic products and there is limited long-term data with respect to potential benefits, effects and/or interaction of these substances with human or animal biochemistry.As a result, our products could have unexpected side effects or safety concerns, the discovery of which could lead to civil litigation, regulatory actions and even possibly criminal enforcement actions.In addition, if the products we sell do not or are not perceived to have the effects intended by the end user, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The statements made by the Company, including in this Annual Report, concerning the potential benefits of cannabis, U.S. hemp and isolated cannabinoids are based on published articles and reports and therefore are subject to the experimental parameters, qualifications and limitations in such studies that have been completed. Although we believe that the existing public scientific literature generally supports our beliefs regarding the benefits, viability, safety, efficacy, dosing and social acceptance of cannabis, U.S. hemp and cannabinoids in dietary supplements, food, or cosmetic products, future research and clinical trials may cast doubt or disprove such beliefs, or could raise or heighten concerns regarding, and perceptions relating to, cannabis, U.S. hemp and cannabinoids, which could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products with the potential to lead to a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Given these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, undue reliance should not be placed on such literature.In particular, the FDA has raised several questions regarding the safety of CBD and other cannabinoids, particularly in food and dietary supplements and gaps in the public scientific literature supporting the use of CBD and other cannabinoids by the general population.Clinical trials of cannabis-based medical products and treatments have a limited history, and any trials may not result in commercially viable products and treatments.Clinical trials are expensive, time consuming and difficult to design and implement. Regulatory authorities may suspend, delay or terminate any clinical trials we commence at any time, may require us, for various reasons, to conduct additional clinical trials, or may require a particular clinical trial to continue for a longer duration than originally planned.Clinical trials face many risks, including, among others:\u2022lack of effectiveness of any formulation or delivery system during clinical trials;\u2022discovery of serious or unexpected toxicities or side effects experienced by trial participants or other safety issues\u037e\u2022slower than expected subject recruitment and enrollment rates in clinical trials\u037e\u2022delays or inability in manufacturing or in obtaining sufficient quantities of materials for use in clinical trials due to regulatory and manufacturing constraints\u037e24Table of Contents\u2022delays in obtaining regulatory authorization to commence a trial, including licenses required for obtaining and using cannabis, U.S. hemp or isolated cannabinoids for research, either before or after a trial is commenced\u037e\u2022unfavorable results from ongoing pre-clinical studies and clinical trials;\u2022trial participants or investigators failing to comply with study protocols\u037e\u2022trial participants failing to return for post-treatment follow-up at the expected rate\u037e\u2022sites participating in an ongoing clinical study withdraw, requiring us to engage new sites\u037e and\u2022third-party clinical investigators declining to participate in our clinical studies, not performing the clinical studies on the anticipated schedule, or acting in ways inconsistent with the established investigator agreement, clinical study protocol or good clinical practices.Any of the foregoing could cause our products or treatments not to be commercially viable, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The controversy surrounding vaporizers and vaporizer products may materially and adversely affect the market for vaporizer products and expose us to litigation and additional regulation.There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving lung and other illnesses and deaths that appear to be related to vaporizer devices and/or products used in such devices (such as vaporizer liquids). The focus has been on the vaporizer devices, the manner in which the devices were used and the related vaporizer device products \u2013 THC, nicotine, other substances in vaporizer liquids, possibly adulterated products and other illegal unlicensed cannabis vaporizer products.Some states, provinces, territories and municipalities in the U.S. and Canada have already taken steps to prohibit the sale or distribution of vaporizers, restrict the sale and distribution of such products or impose restrictions on flavors, substances and concentration of substances used, or use of such vaporizers.This trend may continue, accelerate and expand.Cannabis vaporizers in Canada are regulated under the Cannabis Act, Cannabis Regulations and other laws and regulations of general application.Although this legislation sets rules and standards for the manufacture, composition, packaging, and marketing of cannabis vaporizer products, these rules and standards predate the spate of vaporizer-related health issues that have recently arisen in the U.S. These issues and accompanying negative public sentiment may prompt Health Canada or individual provinces/territories or municipalities to decide to further limit or defer the industry\u2019s ability to sell cannabis vaporizer products and may also diminish consumer demand for such products.Currently, Qu\u00e9bec and Prince Edward Island do not allow the sale of cannabis vaporizers in their respective jurisdictions and Health Canada is seeking to limit the flavors of inhaled cannabis extracts.In June 2021, Health Canada opened a consultation into the use of flavors in inhaled cannabis extracts as it claims that the availability of flavors is one of the factors that contributes to the increase in cannabis vaping in youth and young adults.As part of this consultation, Health Canada released proposed regulations that contemplate restricting the production, sale, promotion, packaging and labelling of inhaled cannabis extracts from having a flavor, other than the flavor of cannabis. The proposed amendments would apply equally to inhaled cannabis extracts sold for medical and non-medical purposes.The proposed amendments were pre-published in June 2021 and the consultation period closed in September 2021.No expected in-force date has been publicly announced.There can be no assurance that the jurisdictions in which we operate will allow the sale of cannabis vaporizers in the future, that other jurisdictions will not prohibit the sale of cannabis vaporizers, that we will be able to meet any additional compliance requirements or regulatory restrictions, or that we will remain competitive in face of unexpected changes in market conditions.An extension of this controversy to non-nicotine vaporizer devices and other product formats could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity, cash flow and operational performance. In February 2020, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control reported that federal and state agencies were investigating an outbreak of over 2,807 lung injury cases associated with the use of vaporizer products, including non-nicotine containing products.Litigation pertaining to vaporizer products is ongoing and that litigation could potentially expand to include our products, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity, cash flow and operational performance.Future research may lead to findings that vaporizers, electronic cigarettes and related products are not safe for their intended use.Vaporizers, electronic cigarettes and related products were recently developed and therefore the scientific or medical communities have had a limited period of time to study the long-term health effects of their use. Currently, there is limited scientific or medical data on the safety of such products for their intended use and the medical community is still studying the health effects of the use of such products, including the long-term health effects.If a consensus were to develop among the scientific or medical community that the use of any or all of these products pose long-term health risks, market demand for these products and their use could materially decline.Such a development could also lead to litigation, reputational harm and significant regulation.Loss of demand for our products, product liability claims and increased regulation stemming from unfavorable scientific studies on vaporizer products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity, cash flow and operational performance.25Table of ContentsWe, or the cannabis and U.S. hemp industries more generally, may receive unfavorable publicity or become subject to negative consumer perception.We believe the cannabis and U.S. hemp industries are highly dependent upon broad social acceptance and consumer perception regarding the safety, efficacy and quality of the cannabis and U.S. hemp products, as well as consumer views concerning regulatory compliance. Consumer perception of our products can be significantly influenced by scientific research or findings, regulatory investigations, litigation, media attention, market rumors or speculation and other publicity regarding the consumption or effects thereof of cannabis and U.S. hemp products.There can be no assurance that future scientific research, findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention or other research findings or publicity will be favorable to the cannabis or U.S. hemp markets or any particular product, or consistent with earlier publicity.Future research reports, findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention or other publicity that are perceived as less favorable than, or that question, earlier research reports, findings or publicity could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our dependence upon consumer perceptions means that adverse scientific research reports, findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention or other publicity, whether or not accurate or with merit, could have a material adverse effect on the demand for products, and our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Further, adverse publicity reports or other media attention regarding the safety, efficacy and quality of U.S. hemp or cannabis in general, or our products specifically, or associating the consumption or use of U.S. hemp or cannabis with illness or other negative effects or events, could have such a material adverse effect.Such adverse publicity reports or other media attention could arise even if the adverse effects associated with such products resulted from consumers\u2019 failure to consume such products legally, appropriately or as directed.The increased usage of social media, artificial intelligence and other web-based tools used to generate, publish and discuss user-generated content and to connect with other users has made it increasingly easier for individuals and groups to communicate and share opinions and views, whether or not true, on our operations and activities and the U.S. hemp and cannabis industries in general, whether true or not. Social media permits user-generated content to be distributed to a broad audience which can respond or react, in near real time, with comments that may be generated by automation and are often not filtered or checked for accuracy.In many cases, we do not have the ability to filter such comments or verify their accuracy.Accordingly, the speed with which negative publicity (whether true or not) can be disseminated has increased dramatically with the expansion of social media and artificial intelligence.The dissemination of negative or inaccurate posts, comments or other user-generated content about us on social media (including those published by third-parties) could damage our brand, image and reputation or how the U.S. hemp or cannabis industries are perceived generally, which could have a detrimental impact on the market for our products and thus on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Certain businesses may have strong economic opposition to the U.S. hemp or cannabis industries. Lobbying by such groups, and any resulting inroads they might make in halting or rolling back the U.S. hemp and cannabis movements, could affect how the U.S. hemp or cannabis industries are perceived by others and could have a detrimental impact on the market for our products and thus on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The parties with which we do business, may perceive that they are exposed to reputational risk as a result of our cannabis or U.S. hemp business activities.Failure to establish or maintain business relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Any third-party service provider or supplier could suspend or withdraw its services to us or require increased fees or compensation if it perceives that the potential risks exceed the potential benefits to such services. For example, we face challenges making U.S. dollar wire transfers or engaging any third-party service provider or supplier with a substantial presence where cannabis is not federally legal (including the U.S.).In these circumstances, while we believe that such services can be procured from other institutions, we may in the future have difficulty maintaining existing, or securing new, bank accounts or clearing services, service providers or other vendors or we may be forced to pay increased fees or compensation for such services.Although we take care in protecting our image and reputation, we do not ultimately have control over how we or the U.S. hemp or cannabis industries are perceived by others.Reputation loss may result in decreased investor confidence, increased challenges in developing and maintaining community relations and an impediment to our overall ability to advance our business strategy and realize on our growth prospects, thereby having a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.26Table of ContentsWe may be subject to litigation in the ordinary course of our marketing, distribution and sale of our products.We are subject to litigation, claims and other legal and regulatory proceedings from time to time in the ordinary course of our manufacturing, marketing, distribution and sale of our products, some of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Several companies in the U.S. hemp-derived CBD industry, including the Company, have become party to an increasing number of purported class actions lawsuits relating to their food and dietary supplement products containing U.S. hemp-derived CBD.While one such case against the Company was dismissed, similar class actions may be filed against us again, and the plaintiffs in such class action lawsuits, as well as in other lawsuits against us, may seek very large or indeterminate amounts, including punitive damages, which may remain unknown for substantial periods of time.Should any litigation in which we become involved be determined against us, such a decision could adversely affect our ability to continue operating, adversely affect the market price for our common shares and require the use of significant resources. Even to the extent we ultimately prevail in litigation, litigation can consume and redirect significant resources.Litigation may also create a negative perception of our brands, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.See Part II, Note 10(b) \u201cContingencies\u201d to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report for a discussion of our legal proceedings.We may be subject to product liability claims.As a manufacturer and distributor of products designed to be ingested by humans, we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims, regulatory action and litigation if our products are alleged to have caused significant loss or injury.In addition, the manufacture and sale of cannabis and U.S. hemp products involve the risk of injury to consumers due to tampering by unauthorized third parties or product contamination. Previously unknown adverse reactions resulting from human consumption of cannabis or U.S. hemp products alone or in combination with other medications or substances could occur as described above under \u201c\u2014 There is limited long-term data with respect to the efficacy and side effects of cannabis, U.S. hemp and cannabinoids and future clinical research studies on the effects of cannabis, U.S. hemp and cannabinoids may lead to conclusions that dispute or conflict with our understanding and belief regarding their benefits, viability, safety, efficacy, dosing and social acceptance.\u201d We have been, and may in the future be, subject to product liability claims that include, among others, our products caused injury or illness, incorrect labeling, inadequate instructions for use or inadequate warnings concerning possible side effects or interactions with other substances. A product liability claim or regulatory action against us could result in increased costs, could adversely affect our reputation with our consumers generally, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.See Part II, Note 10(b) \u201cContingencies\u201d to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report for a discussion on our legal proceedings.There can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain or maintain product liability insurance on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities.Such insurance is expensive and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, or at all.The inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage on reasonable terms or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of products.Our products have in the past and may in the future be subject to recalls.Manufacturers and distributors of products are sometimes subject to the recall or return of their products for a variety of reasons, including, among other things, product defects, such as contamination, unintended harmful side effects or interactions with other substances, packaging safety and inadequate or inaccurate labelling disclosure. Some of our products have been subject to recalls in the past.If one or more of our products are recalled for any reason, we could be required to incur the unexpected expense of the recall and any legal proceedings that might arise in connection with the recall.We may lose a significant number of sales and may not be able to replace those sales at an acceptable margin, or at all.In addition, product recalls have in the past and may in the future require significant management attention.Although we have detailed procedures in place for testing finished products, there can be no assurance that any quality, potency or contamination problems will be detected in time to avoid unforeseen product recalls, regulatory action or lawsuits.If one or more of our products were subject to recall, the public perception of that product and us could be harmed. A recall of one of our products could lead to decreased demand for that product and our other products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Additionally, product recalls may lead to increased scrutiny of our operations by Health Canada, the FDA, the California Department of Public Health (the \u201cCDPH\u201d), the DEA or other regulatory agencies, requiring further management attention and potential legal fees and other expenses.Furthermore, any product recall affecting the cannabis or U.S. hemp industries more broadly could lead consumers to lose confidence in the safety and security of the products sold by participants in these industries generally, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.27Table of ContentsWe rely on third-party testing and analytical methods which are validated but still being standardized.For certain of our cannabis products, testing for cannabinoid levels, heavy metals and pesticides (among other things) is performed by independent third-party testing laboratories. Testing methods and analytical assays for cannabinoids and levels of detection vary among different testing laboratories in different jurisdictions.There is currently no industry consensus on standards for testing methods or an industry accepted compendium of analytical assays or standard levels of detection.The detected and reported cannabinoid content in our cannabis products therefore can differ depending on the laboratory and testing methods (analytical assays) used.Variations in reported cannabinoid content will likely continue until the relevant regulatory agencies and independent certification bodies (e.g., ISO, USP) collaborate to develop, publish and implement standardized analytical assays and levels of detection for cannabis, cannabinoids and their derivative products.Until such standardized analytical assays and levels of detection are developed, the existing differences could cause confusion with our consumers which could lead to a negative perception of us and our products, increase the risk of litigation regarding cannabinoid content and regulatory enforcement action and could make it more difficult for us to comply with regulatory requirements regarding contents of ingredients and packaging and labeling. For example, on June 16, 2020, an alleged consumer filed a Statement of Claim, which has since been dismissed as against the Company, on behalf of a class in the Court of King\u2019s Bench of Alberta in Alberta, Canada, against the Company and other Canadian cannabis manufacturers and distributors alleging claims related to the defendants\u2019 advertised content of cannabinoids in cannabis products for medicinal use on or after June 16, 2010 and cannabis products for adult use on or after October 17, 2018.See Part II, Note 10(b) \u201cContingencies\u201d to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report.The presence of trace amounts of THC in our U.S. hemp products may cause adverse consequences to users of such products that will expose us to the risk of litigation, liability and other consequences.Some of our products that are intended to primarily contain U.S. hemp-derived CBD, or other U.S. hemp-derived cannabinoids, may contain trace amounts of THC. THC is a controlled substance in many jurisdictions, including under the federal laws of the U.S. if it exceeds the cut-off established in the U.S. definition of hemp.Whether or not ingestion of THC (at low levels or otherwise) is permitted in a particular jurisdiction, there may be adverse consequences to consumers of our U.S. hemp products who test positive for any amounts of THC because of the presence of trace amounts of THC in our U.S. hemp products.In addition, certain metabolic processes in the body may negatively affect the results of drug tests.Positive tests for THC may expose us to litigation from our consumers, adversely affect our reputation, and impact individuals\u2019 participation in certain athletic, employment or other activities.A claim or regulatory action against us based on such positive test results could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity, cash flow and operational performance.We may not be able to successfully develop new products or find a market for their sale.The legal cannabis and U.S. hemp industries are in their early stages of development and it is likely that we, and our competitors, will seek to introduce new products, including products that contain cannabinoids other than THC and CBD, in the future. In attempting to keep pace with any new market developments, we may need to spend significant amounts of capital in order to successfully develop and generate revenues from new products we introduce.In addition, we may be required to obtain additional regulatory approvals from Health Canada, the FDA and/or any other applicable regulatory authority, which may take significant amounts of time.We may not be successful in developing effective and safe new products, bringing such products to market in time to be effectively commercialized, or obtaining any required regulatory approvals, and, in the event we are successful, it is possible that there may be little or no demand for the products we develop (including products containing cannabinoids other than THC and CBD with which consumers may not be familiar or have significant reservations), which, together with any capital expenditures made in the course of such product development and regulatory approval processes, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The Canadian excise duty framework may affect our profitability.Canada\u2019s excise duty framework imposes an excise duty and various regulatory-like restrictions on certain cannabis products sold in Canada. We currently hold licenses issued by the Canada Revenue Agency (\u201cCRA\u201d) required to comply with this excise framework.Any change in the rates or application of excise duty to cannabis products sold by us in Canada, and any restrictive interpretations by the CRA or the courts of the provisions of the Excise Act, 2001 (which may be different than those contained in the Cannabis Act) may affect our profitability and ability to compete in the market.Our business may be impacted as a result of conditions in the global economy and financial markets, including changes in inflation, interest rates, and overall economic conditions.Our results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets, including changes in inflation, interest rates and overall economic conditions. The worldwide economy continues to experience significant inflation and inflationary pressures, including, in particular, on wages.Inflation could reduce our purchasing power and negatively impact our ability to obtain goods and services at commercially viable prices.We may be unable to pass on rising costs, including increased employee costs, to our customers.To the extent that we are unable to offset such inflation through higher prices of our products or other cost savings, there would be a negative impact on our operating margins, net income, cash flows and the trading price of our common shares.28Table of ContentsA period of sustained inflation across the markets in which we operate could result in higher operating costs and reduce our profitability.Despite efforts we may take to reduce the impact of inflation on our business across the markets in which we operate, it could become increasingly difficult to effectively mitigate the increases to our costs. In addition, the effects of inflation on consumers\u2019 budgets could result in the reduction of our customers\u2019 spending habits.Additionally, interest rates directly affect the level of interest income we generate from investing our cash and cash equivalents and from our short-term investments.Interest rates are subject to fluctuation, and a decrease in interest rates could negatively impact our interest income.High interest rates have in the past had, and may in the future have, adverse effects on the disposable income of our customers and their spending habits.Risks Relating to Production and Distribution of ProductsOur production facilities, and those of our strategic joint ventures, are integral to our operations, and any adverse changes or developments affecting such facilities may impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our activities and resources are focused on various production and manufacturing facilities including in Canada and Israel and, prior to our exit of our U.S. operations, the U.S. Some licenses are specific to those facilities.Adverse changes or developments affecting our facilities and the facilities of our joint venture partners, including but not limited to a breach of security, an inability to successfully grow cannabis plants or produce finished goods, unanticipated cost overruns in growing or producing products, an outbreak of a communicable illness (such as COVID-19) or a force majeure event, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.As we proceed to complete the pending sale-leaseback of, and effect the change in the nature of operations at, the Peace Naturals Campus, the production and manufacturing facilities that we continue to use have become increasingly important to our business.Any breach of the security measures and other facility requirements, including any failure to comply with recommendations or requirements arising from inspections by regulatory agencies, could also have an impact on our ability to continue operating under our licenses or the prospect of renewing our licenses or could result in a revocation of our licenses.If the sale and leaseback of the Peace Naturals Campus is completed, we anticipate that the tenant rights we are granted under the lease agreement will enable us to complete any necessary maintenance for the Peace Naturals Campus. To the extent that Future Farmco\u2019s cooperation or facilitation is required for such maintenance, and Future Farmco fails to cooperate in a timely manner or at all, we may be unable to complete such maintenance, which may adversely impact our financial performance.Additionally, as we proceed to wind down certain production activities at the Peace Naturals Campus, the production and manufacturing facilities that we continue to use will become increasingly important to our business.We bear the responsibility for all of the costs of maintenance and upkeep at our facilities and our operations and financial performance may be adversely affected if our facilities are unable to keep up with maintenance requirements.We may experience breaches of security at our facilities, which may expose us to the loss of inventory and risks related to violations of applicable laws and regulations.Given the nature of our products and the concentration of inventory in our facilities, we are subject to the risk of theft. A security breach at one of our facilities could expose us to additional scrutiny from regulators, increased expenses and business disruptions relating to the resolution and future prevention of these breaches.We have in the past and may in the future experience unauthorized access to our information technology systems or other cybersecurity incidents, which may make us unable to access or operate business critical systems and which may cause our customers to lose confidence in our cybersecurity, expose us to risks related to violations of applicable laws and regulations, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.A cybersecurity incident or breach may occur in a variety of ways, including, without limitation, a procedural or process failure, information technology malfunction, inadvertent disclosure of sensitive or private information, deliberate unauthorized intrusion, computer virus, and direct or indirect cyberattack or other electronic security breach. Theft of data for competitive or fraudulent purposes, such as customer lists and preferences and other consumer and employee personal information, and trade secrets and other confidential intellectual property is an ongoing and growing risk.Any such theft or cybersecurity incident or breach may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are dependent upon information technology systems in the conduct of our operations, and we collect, store and use certain data, intellectual property, proprietary business information and certain personal information of our employees and customers on those systems, including cloud-based systems.We have been, and expect to continue to be, subject to various cyberattacks and phishing schemes.Additionally, we are undertaking an effort to modernize our information technology systems, which could expose us to additional risks relating to our collection, storage and use of certain data on our systems.29Table of ContentsThere have been many highly publicized cyber-attacks over the last several years and we expect those to continue. Any fraudulent, malicious or accidental breach of our systems could result in unintended disclosure of, or unauthorized access to, third-party, customer, vendor, employee or other confidential information, and could result in additional costs and business disruption to us, including without limitation, to repair or replace damaged systems, enhance security or respond to occurrences, lost sales, violations of data privacy, security or other laws and regulations and subsequent penalties, fines, regulatory action or litigation.We also rely on third-party service providers, including cloud-based systems, for most of our information technology systems, and any data security breach at a third-party service provider could have similar effects.In addition, media or other reports of perceived security vulnerabilities to our systems or those of our third-party providers, even if no breach has been attempted or occurred, could adversely impact our brand and reputation, and customers could lose confidence in our security measures and reliability, which would harm our ability to retain customers and gain new ones. If any of these were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.There can be no assurance that our systems and processes for overseeing and identifying cybersecurity risks will prevent or timely detect a cybersecurity incident.We rely on third-party service providers to assist with these measures.We and our third-party service providers may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate, prevent, respond to, or mitigate cyberattacks or cybersecurity breaches or incidents, and we or they may face difficulties or delays in identifying and responding to cyberattacks, cybersecurity breaches and incidents.We incur significant costs in an effort to detect and prevent cybersecurity breaches and incidents and we expect our costs will increase as we continue to implement systems and processes designed to prevent and otherwise address cybersecurity breaches and incidents. In the event of a significant or material cybersecurity breach or incident, we could be required to expend additional significant capital and other resources in an effort to respond to or prevent further breaches or incidents, which may require us to divert substantial resources from our business.Moreover, we could be required or otherwise find it appropriate to expend significant capital and other resources to respond to, notify third parties of, and otherwise address the breach or incident and its root cause.In recent years, our Information Systems department, which oversees our cybersecurity systems and processes, has experienced high turnover, creating opportunities for knowledge and skill gaps, which can result in operational errors and security oversights.In addition, cybersecurity is not the sole focus of our Information Systems department, and no individual employee is specifically dedicated solely to cybersecurity; competing responsibilities may divert their attention from cybersecurity matters.Any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with laws, regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy, data protection or the protection or transfer of personal data, could adversely affect our business.We collect and store personal information about our customers and employees, including health information, and are responsible for protecting that information. In Canada, for example, we are required to retain certain customer personal information for prescribed periods of time pursuant to the Cannabis Act.In the U.S., for example, we must comply with Americans with Disability Act requirements for confidential employee medical records, including that they must be stored separately from other personnel records and access must be restricted to those who need access.With respect to customer health information, there are a number of federal, state and provincial laws and regulations protecting the confidentiality of certain customer health information, including customer records, and restricting the use and disclosure of that protected information.The privacy rules under the Personal Information Protection and Electronics Documents Act (Canada) (\u201cPIPEDA\u201d) and related provincial laws protect medical records and other personal health information by limiting the use and disclosure of health information to the minimum level reasonably necessary to accomplish the intended purpose and apply to our operations globally. If we were found to be in violation of the privacy or data protection rules under PIPEDA or other applicable laws and regulations protecting the confidentiality of client health information in jurisdictions we operate in, we could be subject to sanctions and civil or criminal penalties, which could increase our liabilities, harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.The jurisdictions in which we operate or which we may enter also have data privacy and data protection laws and regulations that govern the collection, use, disclosure, transfer, storage, disposal, and protection of personal information (such as the California Privacy Rights Act and other similar state laws and regulations, and PIPEDA and related provincial laws in Canada (such as Bill 64 in Quebec)). We may incur significant expenses in an effort to comply with privacy, data protection and information security standards imposed by such laws and regulations, as well as contractual obligations.New and modified laws, and other changes in laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection and information security, may require us to modify our data collection or processing practices and policies, incur substantial costs and expenses to comply with these laws and regulations, and increase our potential exposure to regulatory enforcement and litigation.The interpretation and enforcement of such laws and regulations are uncertain and subject to change and may require substantial costs to monitor and implement compliance.Failure to comply with data privacy and protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include substantial civil and criminal penalties), litigation, business disruption, the diversion of management\u2019s attention and adverse publicity and could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.30Table of ContentsOur cannabis cultivation operations are subject to risks inherent in an agricultural business.Our business and that of our joint venture partners and third-party suppliers involves the growing of cannabis, an agricultural product, in certain jurisdictions where that activity is permitted. As such, the business is subject to the risks inherent in the agricultural business, such as insects, plant diseases and similar agricultural risks that may create crop failures and supply interruptions for our customers.Although our current operational production facilities, and those of our joint venture partners and third-party suppliers, grow products indoors (including in greenhouses) under climate-controlled conditions and we and our joint venture partners and third-party suppliers carefully monitor the growing conditions with trained personnel, there can be no assurance that natural elements will not have a material adverse effect on the production of our products.To the extent we rely on third parties or our joint venture partners to grow cannabis that we intend to commercialize, we are exposed to similar risks and there can be no assurance that such risks will not have a similarly material adverse effect on the production of our products.The inability of our suppliers to meet their financial or contractual obligations to us may result in disruption to our supply chain and could result in financial losses.We face exposure to our third-party suppliers that may face financial difficulties which would impact our supply of products. For example, supply chains throughout the world have been negatively impacted by COVID-19 and this has increased the costs of products and shipping.We have in the past, and may in the future, have disruptions in our supply chain.We rely on third-party distributors and manufacturers to distribute and manufacture certain of our products, and those distributors and manufacturers may not perform their obligations.We rely on third-party distributors and other courier services, and may in the future rely on other third parties, to distribute our products.We also rely on third-party manufacturers to manufacture certain of our products.If these distributors or manufacturers do not successfully carry out their contractual obligations or terminate or suspend their contractual arrangements with us, if there is a delay or interruption in the distribution or manufacturing of our products or if these third parties damage our products, it could negatively impact our revenue and may require significant management attention. In addition, any damage to our products due to acts or omissions of our third-party distributors or manufacturers, such as product spoilage or improper storage or handling, could expose us to potential product liability, damage our reputation and the reputation of our products or brands or otherwise harm our business.Risks Relating to Intellectual PropertyWe are subject to risks related to the protection and enforcement of our intellectual property rights, and we may be unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights.The ownership and protection of our intellectual property rights is a significant aspect of our future success.Currently we rely on trade secrets, technical know-how, proprietary information, trademarks, copyrights, designs and certain patent filings to maintain our competitive position. We try to protect our intellectual property by strategically seeking and obtaining registered protection where appropriate, developing and implementing standard operating procedures to protect trade secrets, technical know-how and proprietary information, and entering into agreements with parties that have access to our inventions, trade secrets, technical know-how and proprietary information, such as our partners, collaborators, employees and consultants, to protect confidentiality and ownership.We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our inventions, trade secrets, technical know-how and proprietary information by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems, and we seek to protect our trademarks and the goodwill associated therewith by monitoring and enforcing against unauthorized use of our trademarks.It is possible that we will inadvertently disclose or otherwise fail or be unable to protect our inventions, trade secrets, technical know-how or proprietary information, or will fail to identify our inventions or trademarks as patentable or registrable intellectual property, or fail to obtain patent or registered trademark protection therefor. Any such disclosure or failure could have a material adverse effect on our business.We may be unable to protect our inventions, trade secrets, and other intellectual property from discovery or unauthorized use.In relation to our agreements with parties that have access to our intellectual property, any of these parties may breach their obligations to us, and we may not have adequate remedies for such breach.In relation to our security measures, such security measures may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for such breach.In addition, our intellectual property that has not yet been applied for or registered may otherwise become known to, or be independently developed by, competitors, or may already be the subject of applications for intellectual property registrations filed by our competitors, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.31Table of ContentsWe cannot provide any assurances that our inventions, trade secrets, technical know-how and other proprietary information will not be disclosed in violation of agreements, or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our intellectual property or independently develop and file applications for intellectual property rights in a manner that adversely impacts our intellectual property rights. For example, we have had employees misappropriate the Company\u2019s confidential information, including intellectual property, including at least one employee who was subsequently employed by a competitor.Unauthorized parties may attempt to replicate or otherwise obtain and use our inventions, trade secrets, technical know-how and proprietary information.Policing the unauthorized use of our current or future intellectual property rights is difficult, expensive, time-consuming and unpredictable, as is enforcing these rights against unauthorized use by others.Identifying unauthorized use of intellectual property rights is difficult.For example, we may be unable to effectively monitor and evaluate the products being distributed by our competitors, including parties such as unlicensed dispensaries, and the processes used to produce such products. If the steps taken to identify and protect our trade secrets are inadequate, we may be unable to enforce our rights in them against third parties.Our intellectual property rights may be invalid or unenforceable under applicable laws, and we may be unable to have issued or registered, and unable to enforce, our intellectual property rights.The laws regarding intellectual property rights relating to cannabis and cannabis-related products, and the positions of intellectual property offices administering such laws, are constantly evolving, and there is uncertainty regarding which countries will permit the filing, prosecution, issuance, registration and enforcement of intellectual property rights relating to cannabis and cannabis-related products.Specifically, we have sought trademark protection in many countries, including Canada, the U.S. and others. Our ability to obtain registered trademark protection for cannabis and cannabis-related goods and services (including U.S. hemp and U.S. hemp-related goods and services) may be limited in certain countries outside of Canada, including the U.S., where registered federal trademark protection is currently unavailable for trademarks covering the sale of U.S.Schedule I cannabis products or certain goods containing U.S. hemp-derived CBD (such as dietary supplements and foods) until the FDA provides clearer guidance on the regulation of such products, and including Europe, where laws on the legality of cannabis use are not uniform, and trademarks cannot be obtained for products that are \u201ccontrary to public policy or accepted principles of morality.\u201d Accordingly, our ability to obtain intellectual property rights or enforce intellectual property rights against third-party uses of similar trademarks may be limited in certain countries.Moreover, in any infringement proceeding, some or all of our current or future trademarks, patents or other intellectual property rights or other proprietary know-how, or arrangements or agreements seeking to protect the same for our benefit, may be found invalid, unenforceable, anti-competitive or not infringed. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our current or future trademarks, patents or other intellectual property rights at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put existing intellectual property applications at risk of not being issued.Any or all of these events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.There is no guarantee that any patent or other intellectual property applications that we file will result in registration or any enforceable intellectual property rights or the breadth of any such protection.Further, with respect to any patent applications that we file, there is no assurance that we will find all potentially relevant prior art relating to such applications, which may prevent a patent from issuing from such application or invalidate any patent that issues from such application. Even if patents do successfully issue, and cover our products and processes, third parties may challenge their validity, enforceability or scope, which may result in such patents being narrowed, found unenforceable or invalidated.Even if they are unchallenged, any patent applications and future patents may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights, provide exclusivity for our products or processes or prevent others from designing around any issued patent claims.Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to prevent competition from third parties, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may be subject to allegations that we are in violation of third-party intellectual property rights, and we may be found to infringe third-party intellectual property rights, possibly without the ability to obtain licenses necessary to use such third-party intellectual property rights.Other parties may claim that our products infringe on their intellectual property rights, including with respect to patents, and our operation of our business, including our development, manufacture and sale of our goods and services, may be found to infringe third-party intellectual property rights. There may be third-party patents or patent applications with claims to products or processes related to the manufacture, use or sale of our products and processes.There may be currently pending patent applications, some of which may still be confidential, that may later result in issued patents that our products or processes may infringe.In addition, third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our inventions, trade secrets, technical know-how and proprietary information, or the manufacture, use or sale of our products, infringes upon those patents.Third parties may also claim that our use of our trademarks infringes upon their trademark rights.Such claims, whether or not meritorious, may result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources, legal fees, injunctions, temporary restraining orders, other equitable relief, and require the payment of damages, any or all of which may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may need to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed on their purported rights, whether or not such allegations have merit.Such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us, and we may be unable to obtain any licenses or other necessary or useful rights to such third-party intellectual property.32Table of ContentsOur germplasm relies heavily on intellectual property, and we may be unable to protect, register or enforce our intellectual property rights in germplasm, and may infringe third-party intellectual property rights with respect to germplasm, possibly without the ability to obtain licenses necessary to use such third-party intellectual property rights.Germplasm, including seeds, clones and cuttings, is the genetic material used in new cannabis varieties and hybrids. We use advanced breeding technologies to produce cannabis germplasm (hybrids and varieties).We rely on parental varieties for the success of our breeding program.Although we believe that the parental germplasm is proprietary to us, we may need to obtain licenses from third parties who may allege that we have appropriated their germplasm or their rights to such germplasm, whether or not such allegations have merit.Such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us, and we may be unable to obtain any licenses or other necessary or useful rights under third-party intellectual property.We may seek to protect our parental germplasm, as appropriate, relying on intellectual property rights, including rights related to inventions (patents and plant breeders\u2019 rights), trade secrets, technical know-how, and proprietary information. There is a risk that we will fail to protect such germplasm or that we will fail to register rights in relation to such germplasm.We have also licensed certain of our germplasm strains to Cronos GrowCo and may be unable to maintain control of these strains if we do not purchase all product derived from such strains.We also seek to protect our parental germplasm, hybrids and varieties from pests and diseases and enhance plant productivity and fertility, and we research products to protect against crop pests and fungus.There are several reasons why new product concepts in these areas may be abandoned, including greater than anticipated development costs, technical difficulties, regulatory obstacles, competition, inability to prove the original concept, lack of demand and the need to divert focus, from time to time, to other initiatives. The processes of breeding, development and trait integration are lengthy, and the germplasm we test may not be selected for commercialization.The length of time and the risk associated with breeding may affect our business.Our sales depend, in part, on our germplasm.Commercial success frequently depends on being the first company to the market, and many of our competitors are also making considerable investments in similar new and improved cannabis germplasm products.Consequently, there is no assurance that we will successfully develop new cannabis germplasm to the point of commercial viability in the markets we serve on a timely basis.Finally, we seek to protect our germplasm, hybrids and varieties from accidental release, theft, misappropriation and sabotage by maintaining physical security of our premises and through contractual rights with our employees and certain of our suppliers, independent contractors, consultants and licensees. However, such security measures may be insufficient or breached, and our employees, independent contractors, consultants and licensees may engage in the inadvertent disclosure, theft, misappropriation or sabotage.We may not have adequate remedies in the case of any such security breach, inadvertent disclosure, theft, misappropriation or sabotage.We receive licenses to use some third-party intellectual property rights and germplasm; the failure of the owner of such intellectual property or germplasm to properly maintain or enforce the intellectual property underlying such licenses or germplasm, as the case may be, or our inability to obtain or maintain such licenses, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and performance.We are party to licenses granted by third parties, including through the Ginkgo Strategic Partnership, which give us rights to use third-party intellectual property and germplasm that is necessary or useful to our business. Our success will depend, in part, on the ability of the applicable licensor to maintain and enforce its licensed intellectual property, including intellectual property underlying licensed germplasm, against other third parties, particularly intellectual property rights to which we have secured exclusive rights.Without protection for the intellectual property we have licensed, or underlying germplasm that we have licensed, as the case may be, other companies might be able to offer substantially similar products for sale or utilize substantially similar processes, publicity and marketing rights or other intellectual property, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our success will also depend, in part, on our ability to obtain licenses to certain intellectual property and germplasm that we believe are necessary or useful for our business. Such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products or services, as well as have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Any of our licensors may allege that we have breached our license agreements with those licensors, whether with or without merit, and accordingly seek to terminate our applicable licenses.If successful, this could result in our loss of the right to use applicable licensed intellectual property or germplasm, which could adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products or services, as well as have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.33Table of ContentsThe technologies, process and formulations we use may face competition or become obsolete.Rapidly changing markets, technology, emerging industry standards and frequent introduction of new products characterize our business. The introduction of new products embodying new technologies, including new manufacturing processes or formulations, and the emergence of new industry standards may render our products obsolete, less competitive or less marketable.The process of developing our products is complex and requires significant continuing costs, development efforts and third-party commitments, including licensees, researchers, and collaborators.Our failure to develop new technologies and products and the obsolescence of existing technologies or processes could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may be unable to anticipate changes in our potential customer preferences or requirements that could make our existing technology, processes or formulations obsolete.Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to enhance our existing technologies, develop new technology that addresses the increasing sophistication and varied views of the market, and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and cost-effective basis. The development of our proprietary technology, processes and formulations entails significant technical and business risks.We may not be successful in using our new technologies or exploiting our niche markets effectively or adapting our business to evolving customer requirements or preferences or emerging industry standards.Risks Relating to Entry into New MarketsEntering into new jurisdictions is inherently risky, may not be successful and could be costly.From time to time, we enter into additional jurisdictions throughout the world, whether directly or through strategic partnerships with local operators who distribute our products.These expansion efforts involve significant risks and uncertainties, including risks related to the ability to obtain and maintain governmental permits and licenses, consumer reception of our products in such jurisdictions, increases in operational complexity, increases in the complexity involved in ensuring our products consistently meet our quality standards, unanticipated delays or challenges, increased strain on our operational and internal resources, our dependence on strategic commercial partnerships, and negative public reception.Our expansion efforts have required, and may in the future require, the dedication of substantial resources. In particular, we may need to make additional investments in management and personnel, infrastructure, operations and compliance systems.Expanding into additional jurisdictions may involve significant up-front capital investments and such investments may not generate our expected return on investment or any return at all.Further, from time to time we may reevaluate and discontinue our participation in such jurisdictions, which could result in write-offs, asset, intangible asset and goodwill impairments, and could otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We will also face new operational risks and challenges as we enter into new markets.Expansion into foreign jurisdictions subjects us to legal, regulatory, reputational and political risks that may be different from and additional to those that we face in jurisdictions in which we currently operate, and we may be at a disadvantage relative to competitors who are more familiar with local markets and local laws and regulations. Similarly, consumer preferences in jurisdictions we enter may differ from those in our existing markets, and our products may not be received by consumers as well as competing products in such jurisdictions.These factors may cause our expansion efforts to be unsuccessful, which may result in write-offs, asset and intangible asset and goodwill impairments, and may otherwise have a material negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.34Table of ContentsControlled substance and other legislation and treaties may restrict or limit our ability to research, manufacture and develop a commercial market for our products outside of the jurisdictions in which we currently operate, and our expansion into such jurisdictions is subject to risks.Approximately 250 substances, including cannabis, are listed in the Schedules annexed to the UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (New York, 1961), the Convention on Psychotropic Substances (Vienna, 1971) and the Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (introducing control on precursors) (Vienna, 1988). The purpose of these listings is to control and limit the use of these drugs according to a classification of their therapeutic value, risk of abuse and health dangers, and to minimize the diversion of precursor chemicals to illegal drug manufacturers.The 1961 UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, as amended in 1972 classifies cannabis as a Schedule I (\u201csubstances with addictive properties, presenting a serious risk of abuse\u201d) narcotic drug.In December 2020, the Commission on Narcotic Drugs voted to remove cannabis from Schedule IV (\u201cthe most dangerous substances, already listed in Schedule I, which are particularly harmful and of extremely limited medical or therapeutic value\u201d).The 1971 UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances classifies tetrahydrocannabinols, which includes delta-9 THC, as a Schedule I psychotropic substance (substances presenting a high risk of abuse, posing a particularly serious threat to public health which are of very little or no therapeutic value). Many countries are parties to these conventions, which govern international trade and domestic control of these substances, including cannabis.They may interpret and implement their obligations in a way that creates legal obstacles to our obtaining manufacturing and/or marketing approval for our products in those countries.These countries may not be willing or able to amend or otherwise modify their laws and regulations to permit our products to be manufactured and/or marketed, and achieving such amendments to the laws and regulations may take a prolonged period of time.There can be no assurance that any market for our products will develop in any jurisdiction in which we do not currently have operations.We may face new or unexpected risks or significantly increase our exposure to one or more existing risk factors, including economic instability, political instability, changes in laws and regulations and the effects of competition. These factors may limit our capability to successfully expand our operations into such jurisdictions and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Investments and joint ventures outside of Canada are subject to the risks normally associated with any conduct of business in foreign countries, including varying degrees of political, legal, regulatory and economic risk.Much of our exposure to markets in jurisdictions outside of Canada is through investments and joint ventures.These investments and joint ventures are subject to the risks normally associated with any conduct of business in foreign and/or emerging countries including political risks; civil disturbance risks; changes in laws, regulations or policies of particular countries, including those relating to royalties, duties, imports, exports and currency; the cancellation or renegotiation of contracts; the imposition of royalties, net profits payments, tax increases or other claims by government entities, including retroactive claims; a disregard for due process and the rule of law by local courts; the risk of expropriation and nationalization; delays in obtaining or the inability to obtain necessary governmental permits or the reimbursement of refundable tax from fiscal authorities.Threats or instability in a country or region caused by political events including elections, change in government, changes in personnel or legislative bodies, foreign relations or military control present serious political and social risk and instability causing interruptions to the flow of business negotiations and influencing relationships with government officials. Changes in policy or law may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The risks include increased \u201cunpaid\u201d state participation, higher energy costs, higher taxation levels and potential expropriation.Other risks include the potential for fraud and corruption by suppliers or personnel or government officials which may implicate us, compliance with applicable anti-corruption laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act (Canada), by virtue of our or our joint ventures and strategic alliances operating in jurisdictions that may be vulnerable to the possibility of bribery, collusion, kickbacks, theft, improper commissions, facilitation payments, conflicts of interest and related party transactions or our joint ventures\u2019 and strategic alliances\u2019 possible failure to identify, manage and mitigate instances of fraud, corruption or violations of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and applicable regulatory requirements.There is also the risk of increased disclosure requirements; currency fluctuations; restrictions on the ability of local operating companies to hold Canadian dollars, U.S. dollars or other foreign currencies in offshore bank accounts; import and export restrictions; increased regulatory requirements and restrictions; increased health-related regulations; limitations on the repatriation of earnings or on our ability to assist in minimizing our expatriate workforce\u2019s exposure to double taxation in both the home and host jurisdictions; and increased financing costs.These risks may limit or disrupt our joint ventures, strategic alliances or investments, restrict the movement of funds, cause us to have to expend more funds than previously expected or required or result in the deprivation of contract rights or the taking of property by nationalization or expropriation without fair compensation, and may materially adversely affect our business, financial position and/or results of operations. In addition, the enforcement by us of our legal rights in foreign countries, including rights to exploit our properties or utilize our permits and licenses and contractual rights may not be recognized by the court systems in such foreign countries or enforced in accordance with the rule of law.35Table of ContentsWe currently do, and may in the future, invest in companies, or engage in joint ventures, in countries with developing economies.It is difficult to predict the future political, social and economic direction of the countries in which we or our joint ventures operate, and the impact government decisions may have on our business.Any political or economic instability in the countries in which we operate could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Risks Relating to Regulation and ComplianceWe operate in highly regulated sectors where the regulatory environment is rapidly developing, and we may not always succeed in complying fully with applicable regulatory requirements in all jurisdictions where we carry on business.Our business and activities are heavily regulated in all jurisdictions where we carry on business. Our operations are subject to various laws, regulations and guidelines by governmental authorities (including, in Canada, Health Canada and other federal, provincial and local regulatory agencies and, in the U.S., the FDA, the USDA, CDPH, DEA, PTO and FTC and other federal and state agencies) relating to the cultivation, manufacture, processing, marketing, labeling, packaging, management, transportation, distribution, import, export, storage, sale, pricing and disposal of cannabis and U.S. hemp, and also including laws, regulations and guidelines relating to health and safety, insurance coverage, the conduct of operations and the protection of the environment (including relating to emissions and discharges to water, air and land, and the handling and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous materials and wastes). Our operations may also be affected in varying degrees by government regulations with respect to, among other things, price controls, import or export controls, controls on currency remittance, increased income taxes, restrictions on foreign investment and government policies rewarding contracts to local competitors or requiring domestic producers or vendors to purchase supplies from a particular jurisdiction.Laws, regulations and guidelines, applied generally, grant government agencies and self-regulatory bodies broad administrative discretion over our activities, including the power to limit or restrict business activities as well as impose additional disclosure requirements on our products and services, as well as on our personnel (including management and our board of directors).Achievement of our business objectives is contingent, in part, upon compliance with regulatory requirements enacted by these governmental authorities and obtaining all necessary regulatory approvals for the cultivation, production, processing storage, transportation, distribution, sale, import and export, as applicable, of our products. The cannabis and U.S. hemp industries are still new, and in Canada in particular, the Cannabis Act has no close precedent in Canadian law.Similarly, the regulatory regimes in the jurisdictions in which we and our joint ventures operate outside of Canada are new and are still being developed without close precedent in such jurisdictions.The effect of relevant governmental authorities\u2019 administration, application and enforcement of their respective regulatory regimes and delays in obtaining, or failure to obtain, necessary regulatory approvals may significantly delay or impact the development of markets, products and sales initiatives and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The regulatory environment for our products is rapidly developing, and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different and changing regulations in multiple jurisdictions increases the possibility that we may violate one or more applicable requirements. While we endeavor to comply with all relevant laws, regulations and guidelines, any failure to comply with the regulatory requirements applicable to our operations could subject us to negative consequences, including, but not limited to, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, asset seizures, revocation or imposition of additional conditions on licenses to operate our business, the denial of regulatory applications (including, in the U.S., by other regulatory regimes that rely on the positions of the DEA and FDA in the application of their respective regimes), the suspension or expulsion from a particular market or jurisdiction of our key personnel, or the imposition of additional or more stringent inspection, testing and reporting requirements, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, scheduled or unscheduled inspections of our facilities or facilities of our joint ventures or third-party suppliers by applicable regulatory agencies could result in adverse findings that could require significant remediation efforts and/or temporary or permanent shutdown of our facilities or those of our joint ventures or third-party suppliers.In the U.S., failure to comply with FDA requirements (and analogous state agencies) may result in, among other things, injunctions, product withdrawals, recalls, product seizures, fines and criminal prosecutions.The outcome of any regulatory or agency proceedings, investigations, inspections, audits, and other contingencies could harm our reputation, require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions that could harm our operations or require us to pay substantial amounts of money, harming our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. There can be no assurance that any pending or future regulatory or agency proceedings, investigations, inspections and audits will not result in substantial costs or a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, negatively impact our future growth plans and opportunities or have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Though the Company exited its U.S. operations in 2023, if the Company\u2019s previous U.S. hemp business activities are found to be in violation of any of U.S. federal, state or local laws or any other governmental regulations, in addition to the items described above, the Company may be subject to \u201cWarning Letters,\u201d fines, penalties, administrative sanctions, settlements, injunctions, product recalls and/or other enforcement actions arising from civil, administrative or other proceedings initiated that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations and the Company\u2019s suppliers and service providers could breach, terminate or otherwise cease to do business with us.36Table of ContentsAs it relates to U.S. Schedule I cannabis, in the U.S., despite cannabis possession and use having been legalized at the state level for medical use in many states and for adult-use in a number of states, marijuana as defined by the CSA continues to be categorized as a Schedule I controlled substance under the CSA and subject to the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (\u201cCSIEA\u201d).Although we do not engage in any activities related to marijuana as defined by the CSA in the U.S., violations of any U.S. federal laws and regulations, including the CSA and the CSIEA, whether intentional or inadvertent, could result in civil, criminal and/or administrative enforcement actions, which could result in fines, penalties, and other sanctions, including but not limited to, cessation of business activities.Additionally, U.S. border officials could deny entry into the U.S. to those employed at or investing in legal and licensed non-U.S. cannabis companies and such persons could face detention, denial of entry or lifetime bans from the U.S. for their business associations with cannabis businesses.We and our joint ventures and strategic investments are reliant on required licenses, authorizations, approvals and permits for our ability to grow, process, store and sell cannabis, and cannabinoids which are subject to ongoing compliance, reporting and renewal requirements, and we may also be required to obtain additional licenses, authorizations, approvals and permits in connection with our business.Our ability to grow, process, store and sell cannabis in Canada is dependent on our licenses from Health Canada, and in particular the licenses currently held by Peace Naturals, Cronos Fermentation and Cronos GrowCo. Failure to comply with the requirements of the licenses or failure to maintain the licenses would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Although we believe Peace Naturals, Cronos Fermentation and Cronos GrowCo will meet the requirements of the Cannabis Act for their licenses, there can be no guarantee that Health Canada will extend or renew the licenses or, if they are extended or renewed, that they will be extended or renewed on the same or similar terms or that Health Canada will not revoke the licenses.Should we fail to comply with requirements of the licenses, should Health Canada not extend or renew the licenses, should they be renewed on different terms (including not allowing for anticipated capacity increases) or should the licenses be revoked or suspended, our business, financial condition and results of the operations will be materially adversely affected. To the extent we apply for any additional licenses from Health Canada, there can be no assurance that such licenses will be granted or, if granted, that they will be granted on commercially reasonable terms or within the time period we expect, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our ability to grow, process, store and sell cannabis in Israel is dependent on maintaining our cannabis cultivation, production and distribution licenses and our ability to export products to, or import products from, Cronos Israel is also dependent on obtaining the relevant permits.Cronos GrowCo\u2019s ability to grow, process, store and sell cannabis at its production facility depends on obtaining and maintaining the appropriate licenses from Health Canada. Should we or our joint ventures fail to comply with the requirements of the licenses, or should they not be extended or renewed by the applicable regulatory authorities, or should they be renewed on different terms (including not allowing for anticipated capacity increases) or should the licenses be revoked, the business, financial condition and results of our and our joint ventures\u2019 operations will be materially adversely affected.There is no assurance that we or our joint ventures will be able to obtain necessary permits or licenses on commercially reasonable terms or within expected time periods, if at all.Moreover, the pending sale-leaseback transaction of, and the change in the nature of operations at, the Peace Naturals Campus will require approval from Health Canada for changes to our site perimeter on the Peace Naturals Campus and will increase the importance of the licenses of Cronos GrowCo for our business and operations. We cannot provide any assurance that the required approval will be obtained from Health Canada on commercially reasonable terms or within expected time periods, if at all.Additionally, given Peace Naturals will no longer own the Peace Naturals Campus following the completion of the pending sale-leaseback transaction, if Future Farmco\u2019s assistance is necessary to comply with the requirements of our Health Canada licenses, there can be no assurance that Future Farmco will assist us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could result in the revocation or suspension of such licenses.In addition, Ginkgo\u2019s ability to conduct certain R&D activities in the U.S. under the Ginkgo Collaboration Agreement is conditional on Ginkgo continuing to maintain all necessary licenses, permits and approvals required for Ginkgo to perform such R&D activities. There are no assurances that Ginkgo will be able to maintain required licenses, permits and approvals and, to the extent such licenses, permits and approvals are not maintained, we may not realize the expected benefits of the Ginkgo Strategic Partnership.Additional government licenses in the future may be required in connection with our operations, in addition to other unknown permits and approvals which may be required.To the extent such permits, and approvals are required and not obtained, we may be prevented from operating and/or expanding our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.37Table of ContentsChanges in the laws, regulations and guidelines governing cannabis and U.S. hemp may adversely impact our business.Our operations are and have been subject to various laws, regulations and guidelines promulgated by governmental authorities (including, in Canada, Health Canada and other federal, provincial and local regulatory agencies and, in the U.S., the FDA, the USDA, CDPH, DEA, FTC and PTO and other federal and state agencies) relating to the cultivation, processing, marketing, acquisition, manufacture, packaging/labeling, management, transportation, distribution, import, export, storage, sale and disposal of cannabis or U.S. hemp but also including laws and regulations relating to health and safety, the conduct of operations and the protection of the environment. Additionally, our growth strategy continues to evolve as regulations governing the cannabis industry in the jurisdictions other than Canada and the U.S. in which we and our joint ventures operate become more fully developed.Interpretation of these laws, rules and regulations and their application to our operations and those of our joint ventures is ongoing.No assurance can be given that new laws, regulations and guidelines will not be enacted or that existing laws, regulations and guidelines will not be amended, repealed or interpreted or applied in a manner which could require extensive changes to our operations, increase compliance costs, give rise to material liabilities or a revocation of our licenses and other permits, restrict the growth opportunities that we currently anticipate or otherwise limit or curtail our operations. For example, the Cannabis Act requires the Canadian federal government to conduct a review of the Cannabis Act after three years, which commenced in September 2022.The scope of this statutory review includes, among other things, consideration of (i) the administration and operation of the Cannabis Act, (ii) the impact of the Cannabis Act on public health, (iii) the health and consumption habits of young persons, (iv) the impact of cannabis on Indigenous persons and communities and (v) the impact of cultivation of cannabis plants in a dwelling-house.This report resulting from the statutory review may recommend and/or lead to the amendment, removal or addition of provisions in or to the Cannabis Act which could adversely affect our business.Amendments to current laws, regulations and guidelines governing the production, sale and use of cannabis and cannabis-based products, more stringent implementation or enforcement thereof or other unanticipated events, including changes in political regimes or political instability, currency controls, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and rates of inflation, labor unrest, changes in taxation laws, regulations and policies, restrictions on foreign exchange and repatriation, governmental regulations relating to foreign investment and the cannabis business more generally, and changes in attitudes toward cannabis, are beyond our control and could require extensive changes to our operations, which in turn may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.While the production of cannabis in Canada, among other things, is under the regulatory oversight of the federal government of Canada, the distribution and retail sale of adult-use cannabis in Canada falls within the jurisdiction of the provincial and territorial governments. The impact of the legislation regulating adult-use cannabis passed in the provinces and territories on the cannabis industry and our business plans and operations is uncertain.Provinces and territories have announced certain restrictions that are more stringent than the federal rules or regulations such as retail sale and marketing restrictions, bans on certain types of cannabis products, raising minimum age of purchase and flavor restrictions.For example, Qu\u00e9bec and Prince Edward Island do not currently permit sales of cannabis vaporizers, and Qu\u00e9bec limits the sale of other high THC non-edible cannabis products.In April 2023, the Supreme Court of Canada affirmed the provinces\u2019 power to enact regulations that are more restrictive than the federal regime.In addition, the distribution and retail channels and applicable rules and regulations in the provinces continue to evolve, and our ability to distribute and retail cannabis products in Canada is dependent on the ability of the provinces and territories of Canada to establish licensed retail networks and outlets. There is no guarantee that the applicable legislation regulating the distribution and sale of cannabis for adult-use purposes will allow for the growth opportunities we currently anticipate and may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.In December 2023, Health Canada released guidance on cannabis products deliberately made with intoxicating cannabinoids other than delta-9-THC.Health Canada defines \u201cintoxicating cannabinoids\u201d as cannabinoids that bind to and activate the CB1 receptor and the guidance includes a list of 9 cannabinoids which can be revised as new evidence becomes available.This guidance recommends that license holders apply the regulatory controls (including limits on the amount of cannabinoids in certain products) currently applicable to delta-9-THC to all other cannabinoids that Health Canada considers to be \u201cintoxicating cannabinoids\u201d in order to minimize the risks of accidental consumption, overconsumption and adverse effects. This guidance comes at a time when various provincial regulators (such as those in Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta) are actively evaluating whether to permit the sale of or how to evaluate limits on the levels of certain cannabinoids (such as tetrahydrocannabivarin and cannabinol).Provincial and territorial distributors may take different positions on the sale and distribution of products with various cannabinoids and may decide to ban, limit or implement new guidance on the types of cannabis products permitted for sale in each of their jurisdictions (including in response to Health Canada\u2019s guidance on intoxicating cannabinoids) which may result in some or all of our products being viewed as non-compliant with law or non-binding policy guidance.Furthermore, additional countries continue to pass laws with respect to the production and distribution of cannabis in some form or another. We have subsidiaries, investments, joint ventures and strategic alliances in place outside of Canada, which may be affected if more countries legalize cannabis.Increased international competition and limitations placed on us by Canadian regulations might lower the demand for our products on a global scale.We also face competition in each jurisdiction outside Canada where we have subsidiaries, investments, joint ventures and strategic alliances with local companies that have more experience, more in-depth knowledge of local markets or applicable laws, regulations and guidelines or longer operating histories in such jurisdictions.38Table of ContentsWe are subject to certain restrictions of the TSX and Nasdaq, which may constrain our ability to expand our business internationally.Our common shares are listed on the TSX and Nasdaq. We must comply with the TSX and Nasdaq requirements or guidelines when conducting business.The TSX has provided clarity regarding the application of Section 306 (Minimum Listing Requirements), Section 325 (Management) and Part VII (Halting of Trading, Suspension and Delisting of Securities) of the TSX Company Manual (collectively, the \u201cRequirements\u201d) to TSX-listed issuers with business activities in the cannabis sector.In TSX Staff Notice 2017- 0009, the TSX notes that issuers with ongoing business activities that violate U.S. federal law regarding U.S.Schedule I cannabis are not in compliance with the Requirements.The TSX reminded issuers that, among other things, should the TSX find that a listed issuer is engaging in activities contrary to the Requirements, the TSX has the discretion to initiate a delisting review. Although we do not conduct any operations in the U.S. with respect to U.S.Schedule I cannabis, failure to comply with the Requirements could result in a delisting of our common shares from the TSX or the denial of an application for certain approvals, such as to have additional securities listed on the TSX, which could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common shares.While Nasdaq has not issued official rules specific to the cannabis or U.S. hemp industry, stock exchanges in the U.S., including Nasdaq, have historically refused to list certain U.S.Schedule I cannabis related businesses, including U.S.Schedule I cannabis retailers, that operate primarily in the U.S. Failure to comply with any requirements imposed by Nasdaq could result in the delisting of our common shares from Nasdaq or denial of any application to have additional securities listed on Nasdaq which could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common shares.We are constrained by law in our ability to market and advertise our products.Our marketing and advertising are subject to regulation by various regulatory bodies in the jurisdictions we operate. In Canada, the development of our business and related results of operations may be hindered by applicable regulatory restrictions on sales and marketing activities.For example, the regulatory environment in Canada limits our ability to compete for market share in a manner similar to other industries.Furthermore, the applicable regulatory restrictions on sales and marketing activities are not always clear, may be subject to interpretation and have in the past, and may in the future, be interpreted or applied inconsistently by the applicable Canadian regulatory agencies, which have broad interpretative and enforcement discretion with respect to such activities.This may result in such restrictions on sales and marketing activities being interpreted unfavorably by a regulatory agency against some market participants, including us, but not others. Furthermore, if our competitors fail to comply with applicable laws relating to sales and marketing activities with which we comply, and regulatory agencies delay or do not take enforcement action against such competitors, or take sporadic enforcement action, our ability to compete for market share and our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected.If we are unable to effectively market our products and compete for market share in Canada, or if the costs of compliance with government legislation and regulation cannot be absorbed through increased selling prices for our products, our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected.See \u201cBusiness \u2013Regulatory Framework in Canada.\u201dIn recent years, the FTC, the FDA and state agencies have initiated numerous investigations of food and dietary supplement products both because of their CBD or cannabinoid content and based on allegedly deceptive or misleading marketing claims and have, on occasion, issued \u201cWarning Letters\u201d or instituted enforcement actions due to such claims. Some U.S. states also permit content, advertising and labeling laws and regulations to be enforced by state attorneys general, who may seek civil and criminal penalties, relief for consumers, class action certifications, class wide damages and recalls of products sold by us.There has also been an increase in private litigation that seeks, among other things, relief for consumers, class action certifications, class wide damages and recalls of products.We have been subject to such litigation and may be subject to additional private class action litigation.Any actions against us by governmental authorities or private litigants could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity, cash flow and operational performance.39Table of ContentsRisks Relating to U.S. Regulation and ComplianceWe are subject to uncertainty regarding the legal and regulatory status of U.S. hemp, including with respect to U.S. federal and state implementation of the 2018 Farm Bill and related laws and regulations, including the FFDCA, and the interpretation or application of such laws and regulations may have material and adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.On December 20, 2018, the 2018 Farm Bill was signed into law. The 2018 Farm Bill, among other things, removes \u201chemp\u201d (which we refer to as \u201cU.S.hemp\u201d in this Annual Report, defined as the plant Cannabis sativa L. and any part of that plant, including the seeds thereof and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers, whether growing or not, with a THC concentration of not more than 0.3% on a dry weight basis and its derivatives) from the U.S. federal Controlled Substances Act and amends the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 to permit the production and sale of U.S. hemp in the U.S. for certain uses under certain conditions.The 2018 Farm Bill provides that its provisions do not preempt or limit state laws that regulate the production of U.S. hemp.Accordingly, some states may choose to restrict or prohibit some or all U.S. hemp production or sales within the state, and variances in states\u2019 laws and regulations on U.S. hemp are likely to persist. Further, each state has discretion to develop and implement its own laws and regulations governing the manufacturing, marketing, labeling, and sale of U.S. hemp products, which has created a patchwork of different regulatory schemes applicable to such products.To the extent a farm bill enacted in the future changes the definition of \u201chemp\u201d or the regulation thereof, including product format or type, our ability to re-enter the U.S. market and launch competitive U.S. hemp products could be negatively impacted.The FDA or particular states may ultimately prohibit the sale of some or all dietary supplements or conventional foods containing U.S. hemp and U.S. hemp-derived ingredients, including CBD and other cannabinoids, and we may be required to submit a New Dietary Ingredient notification to the FDA, which may not be accepted without objection.Under the 2018 Farm Bill, the FDA has retained authority over the FFDCA-regulated products (e.g., drugs (human and animal), food (human and animal), dietary supplements and cosmetics) containing U.S. hemp and U.S. hemp-derived ingredients, including CBD. The FDA has consistently taken the position that CBD, whether derived from U.S. hemp or U.S.Schedule I cannabis, is prohibited from use as an ingredient in food and dietary supplements.This stems from its interpretation of the exclusionary clauses in the FFDCA because CBD is the active ingredient in a drug that has been approved as a prescription drug and is the subject of substantial clinical investigations as a drug, which have been made public.The exclusionary clauses under the FFDCA provide that a substance that has been approved or has been subject to substantial clinical investigations as a drug may not be used in a food or dietary supplement, unless the substance was first marketed in a food or dietary supplement prior to the initiation of substantial clinical investigations of the substance as a drug.To date, the FDA has not issued regulations that elaborate on the exclusionary clauses, and the FDA has not taken any enforcement action in the courts asserting a violation of the exclusionary clauses due to the marketing of U.S. hemp, U.S. hemp extracts, CBD or other cannabinoids. Additionally, on January 26, 2023, the FDA stated its views publicly that a new regulatory pathway for CBD is needed and it is prepared to work with Congress to create such a pathway.To date, the FDA has issued several \u201cWarning Letters\u201d to companies unlawfully marketing CBD products.In many of these cases, the manufacturer made unsubstantiated claims about the product being able to treat medical conditions (e.g., cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, opioid withdrawal, anxiety and COVID-19) and had not obtained drug approvals.Some of these letters were co-signed with the FTC and cited the companies for making claims about the efficacy of CBD or other ingredients which were not substantiated by competent and reliable scientific evidence.The FDA has also issued a \u201cWarning Letter\u201d to at least one dietary supplement manufacturer for a number of violations observed during an inspection, including manufacturing CBD supplements in a licensed facility. In November 2022, the FDA issued \u201cWarning Letters\u201d to five additional companies selling CBD-products in forms that the FDA asserted are appealing to children, including gummies, hard candies and cookies.And in December 2023, the FDA issued a \u201cWarning Letter\u201d that stated that the FDA considers neither delta-8 tetrahydrocannabinol nor CBD to be \u201cgenerally recognized as safe\u201d (GRAS) food additives.These letters also outlined additional violations of the FFDCA including that several of the companies made claims that CBD-containing products cure, mitigate, treat or prevent various diseases or were added to animal foods.Until the FDA formally adopts regulations with respect to CBD or other U.S. hemp-derived cannabinoid products or announces an official position with respect to CBD or other U.S. hemp-derived cannabinoid products, there is a risk that the FDA could take enforcement action (e.g., a \u201cWarning Letter,\u201d seizure, or injunction) against the Company in respect of its U.S. hemp-derived products sold in the U.S.Moreover, states have retained regulatory authority through their own analogues to the FFDCA, and the states may diverge from the federal treatment of the use of U.S. hemp as, or in, food, dietary supplements or cosmetic products.40Table of ContentsEven if the exclusionary clause issue discussed above is resolved in a manner favorable to us and we decide to re-enter the U.S. hemp market, we could be required to submit a NDIN to the FDA with respect to U.S. hemp-derived ingredients, including CBD and other cannabinoids we intend to include in our products, used in dietary supplement products. This could depend on whether we can establish that a particular ingredient was marketed as a dietary ingredient in a dietary supplement prior to October 15, 1994, or is otherwise currently in the food supply in the same chemical form as used in our dietary supplement products.If the FDA objects to such an NDIN, this could prevent us from producing, marketing and selling ingestible U.S. hemp products.Such an NDIN submitted by one of our competitors was objected to by the FDA in August 2021.The DEA could take enforcement action against us or other participants in the U.S.Schedule I cannabis or U.S. hemp industry.Any rescheduling of U.S.Schedule I cannabis to Schedule III would have an uncertain impact on our business.There is substantial uncertainty concerning the legal status of U.S. hemp and U.S. hemp products containing U.S. hemp-derived ingredients, including CBD and other cannabinoids. The status of products derived from the cannabis or hemp plant, under both federal and state law can depend on the THC content of the plant or derivative (including whether the plant meets the statutory definition of \u201cindustrial hemp\u201d or \u201chemp\u201d), the part of the plant from which an individual or entity produces the derivative (including whether the plant meets the statutory definition of \u201cmarihuana\u201d under the CSA), the THC concentration during the manufacturing process, whether the cultivator, processor, manufacturer or product marketer engages in cannabis-related activities for research versus purely commercial purposes, as well as the form and intended use of the product.The mere presence of a cannabinoid (such as CBD) is not dispositive as to whether the product is legal or illegal.Under U.S. federal law, products containing CBD may be unlawful if derived from U.S. Schedule I cannabis (including hemp with a concentration greater than 0.3% THC on a dry weight basis), or if derived from U.S. hemp grown outside the parameters of an approved U.S. hemp pilot program or U.S. hemp cultivated in violation of the 2018 Farm Bill.Even after enactment of the 2018 Farm Bill, the DEA may not treat all products containing U.S. hemp-derived ingredients, including CBD and other cannabinoids, as exempt from the CSA.In September 2020, the DEA issued an interim final rule that purported to align the DEA\u2019s regulations with the statutory changes to the CSA made effective by the 2018 Farm Bill.The DEA received a number of comments objecting to the interim final rule, and the interim final rule has been the subject of litigation.However, the litigation was dismissed by the D.C. Circuit Court in June 2022.If the DEA takes action against us or other participants in the U.S. hemp industry, this could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.In August 2023, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d) recommended that the DEA move marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III under the CSA.There can be no assurance that the DEA will ultimately adopt HHS\u2019s recommendation and the impacts of any such adoption on our business and competitive position are unclear.For example, rescheduling marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III may be accompanied by additional regulatory obligations as prerequisite to participate in the U.S. market, and it may provide a greater benefit to the businesses of our competitors than our business, including by providing favorable tax treatment to their U.S. operations. The rescheduling of marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III could result in significant volatility in the market for our common stock.To the extent that market speculation results in an increase in the price of our stock, our stock price could decline significantly thereafter if the DEA fails to act on the recommendation or investor optimism fades.Risks Relating to CompetitionThe markets in which we operate are increasingly competitive, and we may compete for market share with other companies, both domestically and internationally, that may have longer operating histories and more financial resources, manufacturing and marketing experience than us.The market for cannabis is competitive and evolving and we face strong competition from both existing and emerging companies that offer similar products. Some of our current and potential competitors may have longer operating histories, greater financial, marketing and other resources and larger customer bases than we have.In addition, there is potential that the cannabis industry will undergo consolidation, creating larger companies with financial resources, manufacturing and marketing capabilities and product offerings that are greater than ours.As a result of this competition, we may be unable to maintain our operations or develop them as currently proposed on terms we consider acceptable, or at all.Increased competition from larger, better-financed competitors with geographic advantages could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Given the rapid changes affecting global, national and regional economies generally, we may not be able to create and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Our success will depend on our ability to respond to, among other things, changes in the economy, regulatory conditions, market conditions and competitive pressures.Any failure by us to anticipate or respond adequately to such changes could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity, cash flow and operational performance.41Table of ContentsIn Canada, the number of licenses granted by Health Canada could also have an impact on our operations.We expect to face additional competition from new market entrants that are granted licenses under the Cannabis Act or existing license holders which are not yet active in the industry.If a significant number of new licenses are granted by Health Canada in the near term, we may experience increased competition for market share and may experience downward price pressure on our products as new entrants increase production. If the number of users of cannabis in Canada increases, the demand for products will increase and we expect that competition will become more intense, as current and future competitors begin to offer an increasing number of diversified products.To remain competitive, we will require a continued high level of investment in R&D, sales and customer support.We may not have sufficient resources to maintain R&D, sales and customer support efforts on a competitive basis which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Furthermore, the Canadian federal authorization of home cultivation, outdoor grow, and the easing of other barriers to entry to the Canadian adult-use cannabis market, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We face competition from the illegal cannabis market.We face competition from illegal market participants that are unlicensed and unregulated. As these illegal market participants do not comply with the regulations governing the cannabis industry, their operations may also have significantly lower costs and they may be able to sell products with significantly higher cannabinoid potencies or which include ingredients that are prohibited by law.The perpetuation of the illegal market for cannabis may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition as well as the perception of cannabis use.Regulatory non-compliance by licensed cannabis competitors may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.In addition to competition from illegal market participants, we may also face competition from licensed cannabis competitors that fail to comply with the regulations governing the cannabis industry when developing and selling cannabis products. These competitors may be able to produce and sell products with significantly higher cannabinoid potencies or which include ingredients that are prohibited by law.If regulatory authorities are delayed in, or fail to, effectively restrict the sale and distribution of such non-compliant cannabis products by our competitors, there may be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the perception of cannabis use.We have been and may in the future be required to write down inventory due to downward pressure on market prices, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.At the end of each reporting period, management performs an assessment of inventory obsolescence, prices and demand to measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation.We also consider factors such as slow-moving or non-marketable products in our determination of obsolescence.As a result of this assessment, inventory write-downs have occurred on a number of occasions in the past and may occur in the future.Continued pricing pressures in the markets in which we operate, may result in further inventory write-downs.We have had a series of inventory write-downs due to price compression in the cannabis market.We expect these write-downs to continue as pricing pressures remain elevated.These inventory write-downs have in the past and may in the future materially adversely affect our results of operations.We may be unable to attract or retain skilled labor and personnel with experience in the cannabis sector and may be unable to attract, develop and retain additional employees required for our operations and future developments.We may be unable to attract or retain employees with sufficient experience in the cannabis industry, and may prove unable to attract, develop and retain additional employees required for our development and future success.Our success is currently largely dependent on the performance of our skilled employees. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees.Qualified individuals are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract and retain them.In 2022, we announced a Realignment to, among other things, centralize functions under common leadership to increase efficient distribution of resources, optimize collaboration and strategic alignment and eliminate duplication of roles and costs, including a reduction in headcount impacting a number of employees.In 2023, we exited our U.S. operations, announced our intention to list the Cronos Fermentation facility for sale and entered into a transaction for the sale and leaseback of the Peace Naturals Campus.Any or all of the Realignment, the U.S. exit, the planned sale of the Cronos Fermentation facility and the pending sale-leaseback transaction could lead to increased attrition amongst those employees who were not directly affected by the associated reductions in headcount, and we may not be successful at retaining such employees or attracting new employees, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Further, certain shareholders, directors, officers, employees and contractors in our Canadian operations may require security clearance from Health Canada or require analogous clearance by various provincial agencies. Under the Cannabis Act, a security clearance cannot be valid for more than five years and must be renewed before the expiry of a current security clearance.There is no assurance that any of our existing personnel who presently or may in the future require a security clearance will be able to obtain or renew such clearances or that new personnel who require a security clearance will be able to obtain one.A failure by any of our existing personnel to maintain or renew his or her security clearance may impair our business operations.In addition, if an individual with security42Table of Contentsclearance leaves the service of the Company and we are unable to find a suitable replacement who has a security clearance required by the Cannabis Act in a timely manner, or at all, there could occur a material adverse effect on our business operations. Similar risks and potential effects apply to analogous security clearances required by various provincial agencies.Risks Relating to the Altria InvestmentAltria has significant influence over us following closing of the Altria Investment.Altria is our single largest shareholder.As of December 31, 2023, Altria beneficially owned approximately 41.1% of our issued and outstanding common shares (calculated on a non-diluted basis).In light of such ownership, Altria is in a position to exercise significant influence over matters affecting shareholders or requiring shareholder approval, including the election of the Board, amendments to our articles and the determination of significant corporate actions.In addition, pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement, Altria has certain rights, including the right to nominate a specified number of directors to the Board, approval rights over certain Company actions and pre-emptive and top-up rights entitling Altria to maintain its pro rata beneficial ownership in us. Further, as of the date hereof, four of the seven directors on the Board are Altria Nominees.For more information, see \u201cBusiness\u2014Altria Strategic Investment\u2014Investor Rights Agreement.\u201dAccordingly, Altria currently has significant influence over us.There can be no assurance that Altria\u2019s interests will align with our interests or the interests of other shareholders.In addition, such influence could limit the price that an acquirer might be willing to pay in the future for our common shares and it may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us, such as a merger or take-over.We have discretion in the use of net proceeds from the Altria Investment and may not use them effectively.Under the Subscription Agreement, we have discretion in the use of net proceeds from the Altria Investment, subject to our obligation to consult with Altria, in certain circumstances, seek the approval of Altria (such approval not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed) and certain other limitations regarding the use of net proceeds set forth in the Subscription Agreement. Accordingly, shareholders may not agree with the manner in which management chooses to allocate and spend the net proceeds.Our failure to apply the funds effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We have cash on hand, including short-term investments, of approximately $861 million as of December 31, 2023.There can be no assurance that we will be able to deploy the available cash in an effective manner that is accretive to us, or at all.Until such time as we are able to deploy the cash available to us, we anticipate holding the net proceeds as cash balances in our bank accounts, investing in certificates of deposit and other instruments issued by banks or obligations of or guaranteed by the Government of Canada or any province thereof, or investing in U.S. Treasury securities or other obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, its agencies or instrumentalities.We may not realize the benefits of our strategic partnership with Altria, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We believe that the strategic partnership between us and Altria provides us with additional financial resources, product development and commercialization capabilities, and deep regulatory expertise to better position us to compete, scale and lead the rapidly growing global cannabis industry. We believe that the growth opportunities for us are significant and could extend across the globe as new markets open.With Altria\u2019s resources, we expect to be even better positioned to support cannabinoid innovation, create differentiated products and brands across medical and adult-use categories and expand our global footprint and growing production capacity.Nevertheless, a number of risks and uncertainties are associated with the expansion into such markets and the pursuit of these other growth opportunities.The successful implementation of the Altria Investment is critical to our growth and capital position.The failure to successfully implement or reap the anticipated benefits of Altria\u2019s resources and expertise to realize growth and expansion opportunities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Altria\u2019s significant interest in us may impact the liquidity of our common shares.Our common shares may be less liquid and trade at a discount relative to the trading that could occur in circumstances where Altria did not have the ability to significantly influence or determine matters affecting us. Additionally, Altria\u2019s significant voting interest in us may discourage transactions involving a change of control of us, including transactions in which an investor, as a shareholder, might otherwise receive a premium for its common shares over the then-current market price.Future sales of our common shares by Altria could cause the market price for our common shares to fall.Sales of a substantial number of our common shares by Altria could occur at any time.Such sales, or the market perception of such sales, could significantly reduce the market price of our common shares.We cannot predict the effect, if any, that future public sales of our common shares beneficially owned by Altria or the availability of these common shares for sale will have on the market price of our common shares.If the market price of our common shares were to drop as a result, this might impede our ability to raise additional capital and might cause a significant decline in the value of the investments of our other shareholders.43Table of ContentsThe intentions of Altria regarding its long-term economic ownership of our common shares are subject to change as a result of changes in the circumstances of Altria or its affiliates, changes in our management and operation and changes in laws and regulations, market conditions and our financial performance.Conflicts of interest may arise between us and our directors and officers, including as a result of the continuing involvement of certain of our directors with Altria and its affiliates.We may be subject to various potential conflicts of interest because of the fact that some of our directors and officers may be engaged in a range of business activities, or have relationships with or are employed by Altria. One of our directors, Jason Adler, is the co-founder and Managing Member of Gotham Green Partners, a private equity firm focused primarily on early-stage investing in companies in the cannabis industry, and Michael Gorenstein, our Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, is a co-founder and non-managing Member of Gotham Green Partners.Three of our directors, Kamran Khan, Dominik Meier and Elizabeth Seegar, are employed by Altria as Vice President and Associate General Counsel, Vice President of Consumer & Marketplace Insights & Innovation, and Vice President, Financial Planning & Analysis , respectively.As a result of these relationships, conflicts of interests may arise between us and them, as described below.We may also become involved in other transactions that are inconsistent or conflict with the interests of our directors and officers, and/or our directors and officers may have interests in persons, firms, institutions, corporations or transactions that are inconsistent or in conflict with our interests and those of our shareholders. In addition, from time to time, Gotham Green Partners or Altria may be competing with us for available investment opportunities.Conflicts of interest, if any, will be subject to the procedures and remedies provided under applicable laws and regulations.In particular, in the event that such a conflict of interest arises at a meeting of our directors, a director who has such a conflict will abstain from voting for or against the approval of the transaction and may recuse himself or herself from any related discussion or deliberation.In accordance with applicable laws and regulations, our directors are required to act honestly, in good faith and in our best interests.Risks Relating to Our Common SharesIt is not anticipated that any dividend will be paid to holders of our common shares for the foreseeable future.No dividends on our common shares have been paid to date. We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, for future operations and expansion.Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of the Board and will depend on, among other things, financial results, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that the Board may deem relevant.Any changes to our policy with respect to the declaration and payment of any dividends requires Altria\u2019s approval.As a result, investors may not receive any return on an investment in our common shares unless they sell their shares for a price greater than that which such investors paid for them.The market price for our common shares has in the past been volatile and may continue to be volatile and subject to significant fluctuation.The market price for our common shares has been volatile and subject to wide fluctuations and may continue to be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to many factors, including:\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations;\u2022changes in estimates of our future results of operations by us or securities research analysts;\u2022changes in the economic performance or market valuations of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\u2022additions or departures of our executive officers and other key personnel;\u2022our restating financial results twice in the last five years;\u2022sales of additional common shares or the perception in the market that such sales might occur;\u2022significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, investments, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors;\u2022increases in speculative trading activity by investors targeting publicly traded cannabis companies, which can further contribute to the volatility of the market price for our common shares if aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of our common shares available for purchase;\u2022news reports relating to trends, concerns or competitive developments, regulatory changes or enforcement actions and other related issues in our industry or target markets;\u2022the prospect of actual or perceived future changes to the legal and regulatory regimes that govern our products and our industries;\u2022investors\u2019 general perception of us and the public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC and Canadian securities regulators;\u2022our failure to timely file our public filings with the SEC and Canadian securities regulators;\u2022our failure to comply with the Nasdaq and TSX rules and potential trading halts or delisting notices;\u2022reports by industry analysts, investor perceptions, and market rumors or speculation; and44Table of Contents\u2022negative announcements by our customers, competitors or suppliers regarding their own performance.For example, reports by industry analysts, investor perceptions, market rumors or speculation could trigger a sell-off in our common shares. Any sales of substantial numbers of our common shares in the public market or the perception that such sales might occur may cause the market price of our common shares to decline.In addition, to the extent that other large companies within our industries experience declines in their stock price, the price of our common shares may decline as well.Moreover, if the market price of our common shares drops significantly, shareholders may institute securities class action lawsuits against us.Lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management and other resources.Securities markets continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations that have, in some cases, been unrelated to the operating performance, underlying asset values or prospects of public companies. Accordingly, the market price of our common shares may decline even if our results of operations, underlying asset values or prospects have not changed.In addition, certain institutional investors may base their investment decisions on consideration of our environmental, governance, diversity and social practices and performance against such institutions\u2019 respective investment guidelines and criteria, and failure to meet such criteria may result in limited or no investment in our common shares by those institutions, which could adversely affect the trading price of our common shares.There can be no assurance that continuing fluctuations in price and volume will not occur.If such increased levels of volatility and market turmoil continue, the trading price of the common shares may be adversely affected.Securities class action litigation often has been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. We have been the target of such litigation and may in the future be the target of similar litigation.Regardless of merit, such litigation could result in substantial costs and damages and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business.Any adverse determination in litigation against us could also subject us to significant liabilities.We may require additional capital in the future or be required to issue common shares pursuant to certain of our agreements, which may dilute holders of our securities.We may be required to issue additional common shares pursuant to the Ginkgo Collaboration Agreement.Pursuant to the Ginkgo Collaboration Agreement, upon Ginkgo\u2019s demonstration that the microorganisms they develop are capable of producing certain target cannabinoids above a minimum productivity level, we will issue to Ginkgo up to approximately 14.7 million common shares in the aggregate. To date, we have issued approximately 7.1 million common shares to Ginkgo in respect of certain Equity Milestone Events that have occurred.Additional tranches of common shares will be issued if and when additional Equity Milestone Events are reached.The issuance of such common shares, if any, would dilute holders of our common shares.In addition, Altria has pre-emptive rights to subscribe for additional common shares in us following any issuances we make to Ginkgo pursuant to the Ginkgo Collaboration Agreement, and the issuance of such common shares, if any, would further dilute holders of our common shares.Holders of common shares will have no pre-emptive rights in connection with such further issuances.Our Board has the discretion to determine if an issuance of common shares is warranted, the price at which such issuance is effected and the other terms of issue of common shares. Any additional capital raised through the sale of equity will dilute the percentage of ownership of holders of our common shares.Capital raised through debt financing would require us to make periodic interest payments and may impose restrictive covenants on the conduct of our business.A substantial number of our securities are owned by a limited number of existing shareholders.Our management, directors and employees own a substantial number of our outstanding common shares (on a fully diluted basis).In addition, as of December 31, 2023, Altria beneficially owned approximately 41.1% of our outstanding common shares (calculated on a non-diluted basis).As such, our management, directors and employees, as a group, and Altria each are in a position to exercise significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors and the determination of significant corporate actions. In addition, these shareholders could delay or prevent a change in control that could otherwise be beneficial to holders of common shares.Investors in the U.S. may have difficulty bringing actions and enforcing judgments against us and others based on securities law civil liability provisions.We are incorporated under the laws of the Province of British Columbia and our head office is located in the Province of Ontario.Some of our directors and officers and some of the experts named in this Annual Report are residents of Canada or otherwise reside outside of the U.S., and a substantial portion of their assets and our assets are located outside the U.S. Consequently, it may be difficult for investors in the U.S. to bring an action against such directors, officers or experts or to enforce against those persons or us a judgment obtained in a U.S. court predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws or other laws of the U.S. In addition, while statutory provisions exist in British Columbia for derivative actions to be brought in certain circumstances, the circumstances in which a derivative action may be brought, and the procedures and defenses that may be available in respect of any such action, may be different than those of shareholders of a company incorporated in the U.S.45Table of ContentsIf we are a passive foreign investment company for U.S. federal income tax purposes in any year, certain adverse tax rules could apply to U.S. holders of our common shares.We will be classified as a passive foreign investment company (\u201cPFIC\u201d) for any taxable year for U.S. federal income tax purposes if for a taxable year, (i) 75% or more of our gross income is passive income, or (ii) 50% or more of the value of our assets either produce passive income or are held for the production of passive income, based on the quarterly average of the fair market value of such assets. The determination of PFIC status depends on interpretive rules and computational conventions that are often unclear.In particular, in making our determination, we are relying on the application of certain \u201clook-through\u201d rules, taking into account certain intercompany items (including our interests in subsidiaries).There is, however, no direct legal authority applying these look-through rules to our particular situation (including to what extent, they apply to intercompany items).Likewise, in light of the volatility of our common share price, we intend to take the position that the spot trading price of our stock at each quarter end, as adjusted by liabilities, does not dictate the determination of the fair market value of our assets.Based on current business plans and financial expectations, an independent valuation analysis in respect of our assets, and the application of certain look-through rules (including to certain intercompany items and to our interests in our subsidiaries), we do not expect to be a PFIC for the taxable year ending December 31, 2024. However, PFIC status is determined annually and depends upon the composition of our gross income and assets, both of which are subject to change.Moreover, there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) or a court will agree with our interpretation of fair market value or its computation, or with our interpretation of the PFIC rules (including the \u201clook-through\u201d rules and the scope of their application, including in respect of intercompany items).Therefore, there can be no assurance as to our PFIC status for the current taxable year or for future taxable years, nor any assurance that the IRS or a court will agree with our determination of our PFIC status.If securities or industry analysts do not publish research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.The trading market for our common shares depends, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common shares or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the trading price of our common shares would likely decline.In addition, if our results of operations fail to meet the forecasts of analysts, the trading price of our common shares would likely decline.If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common shares could decrease, which might cause our trading price and trading volume to decline.General RisksWe are dependent on our senior management.Our success is dependent upon the ability, expertise, judgment, discretion and good faith of our senior management.While employment agreements are customarily used as a primary method of retaining the services of key employees, these agreements cannot assure the continued services of our senior management team. Qualified individuals are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract and retain them.The loss of the services of a member of senior management, or an inability to attract other suitably qualified persons when needed, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to execute on our business plan and strategy, and we may be unable to find adequate replacements on a timely basis, or at all.We do not maintain key-person insurance on the lives of any of our officers or employees.We may be unable to obtain insurance coverage at acceptable rates and there may be coverage limitations and other exclusions which may not be sufficient to cover our potential liabilities.We have insurance to protect our assets, operations and employees.Our insurance coverage, however, is subject to deductibles, coverage limits and exclusions and may not be available or adequate for the risks and hazards to which we are exposed. No assurance can be given that insurance will be generally available in the future or, if available, that premiums and deductibles will be commercially justifiable.If we were to incur substantial liability claims and such damages were not covered by insurance or were in excess of policy limits, or if we were to incur such liability at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Furthermore, our insurers have in the past and may in the future deny us coverage, whether or not such denial is with merit, and we have in the past and may in the future need to commence litigation against such insurers, which could be time consuming and expensive and divert significant management resources, with no assurance that we will be successful in any resulting proceedings.46Table of ContentsTax and accounting requirements may be interpreted or changed in ways that are complex and not necessarily anticipated by us, and we may face difficulty or be unable to implement and/or comply with any such interpretations or changes.We are subject to numerous tax and accounting requirements, and changes in existing accounting or taxation rules or practices, or varying interpretations of current rules or practices, could have a significant adverse effect on our financial results, the manner in which we conduct our business or the marketability of any of our products. In many countries, we are subject to transfer pricing and other tax regulations designed to ensure that appropriate levels of income are reported as earned and are taxed accordingly.Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable regulations and restrictions, we are subject to the risk that governmental authorities could audit our transfer pricing and related practices and assert that additional taxes are owed or that various jurisdictions could assert that we should file tax returns in jurisdictions where we do not file and subject us to additional tax.In the future, the geographic scope of our business may expand, and such expansion will require us to comply with the tax laws and regulations of additional jurisdictions.Requirements as to taxation vary substantially among jurisdictions. Complying with the tax laws and regulations of these jurisdictions can be time consuming and expensive and could potentially subject us to penalties and fees in the future if we failed to comply.In the event that we failed to comply with applicable tax laws and regulations, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Natural disasters, unusual weather, pandemic outbreaks, boycotts and geopolitical events or acts of terrorism could adversely affect our operations and financial results.The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, floods and earthquakes, unusually adverse weather, pandemic outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 virus, influenza and other highly communicable diseases or viruses, boycotts and geopolitical events, such as civil unrest in countries in which our or our joint ventures\u2019 operations are located and acts of terrorism, or similar disruptions could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These events could result in physical damage to one or more of our or our joint ventures\u2019 properties, increases in fuel or other energy prices, the temporary or permanent closure of one or more of our or our joint ventures\u2019 facilities, the temporary lack of an adequate workforce in a market, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from suppliers, the temporary disruption in the transport of goods, delay in the delivery of goods to our or our joint ventures\u2019 facilities, and disruption to our information systems.Such events could also negatively impact consumer sentiment, reduce demand for consumer products like ours and cause general economic slowdown.Our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations and expectations, including with respect to environmental, social and governance matters, which could expose us to numerous risks.We are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self-regulatory organizations, including the SEC, Nasdaq and the Financial Accounting Standards Board. These rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity.In addition, increasingly regulators, customers, investors, employees and other stakeholders are focusing on environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) matters and related disclosures.These changing rules, regulations and stakeholder expectations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and increased management time and attention spent complying with or meeting such regulations and expectations.For example, developing and acting on initiatives within the scope of ESG, and collecting, measuring and reporting ESG related information and metrics can be costly, difficult and time consuming and is subject to evolving reporting standards, including the SEC\u2019s proposed climate-related reporting requirements, and similar proposals by other international regulatory bodies. We may also communicate certain initiatives and goals, regarding environmental matters, diversity, responsible sourcing and social investments and other ESG related matters, in our SEC filings or in other public disclosures.These initiatives and goals within the scope of ESG could be difficult and expensive to implement, the technologies needed to implement them may not be cost effective and may not advance at a sufficient pace, and we could be criticized for the accuracy, adequacy or completeness of the disclosure.Further, statements about our ESG related initiatives and goals, and progress against those goals, may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future. In addition, we could be criticized for the scope or nature of such initiatives or goals, or for any revisions to these goals.If our ESG-related data, processes and reporting are incomplete or inaccurate, or if we fail to achieve progress with respect to our initiatives or goals within the scope of ESG on a timely basis, or at all, our reputation, business, financial performance and growth could be adversely affected.Climate change may disrupt our business and our efforts to address concerns relating to climate change could result in damage to our reputation.Our business and that of our joint venture partners and third-party suppliers involves the growing of cannabis, an agricultural product, and adverse weather conditions have historically caused volatility in the agricultural industry and consequently in operating results by causing crop failures or significantly reduced harvests, which may negatively affect the supply and pricing of agricultural commodities, such as cannabis. Additionally, the potential physical impacts of climate change are uncertain and may vary by region.These potential effects could include changes in rainfall patterns, water shortages, changing sea levels, changing storm patterns and intensities, and changing temperature levels that could adversely impact our costs and business operations, the location, costs, and competitiveness of cannabis production and related storage and processing facilities and the supply of cannabis.47Table of ContentsWe are also exposed to risks resulting from changes in public policy, laws and regulations, or market and public perceptions and preferences in connection with the transition to a less carbon-dependent economy.These changes could adversely affect our business, results of operations and reputation.Our financial performance is subject to risks of foreign exchange rate fluctuation, which could result in foreign exchange losses.We may be exposed to fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against certain other currencies, particularly the Canadian dollar and Israeli Shekel, because we publish our financial statements in U.S. dollars, while a significant portion of our assets, liabilities, revenues and costs are or will be denominated in other currencies. Exchange rates for currencies of the countries in which we operate may fluctuate in relation to the U.S. dollar, and such fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our earnings or assets when translating foreign currency into U.S. dollars.We do not hedge our exchange rate so any changes in exchange rates will directly affect our earnings.Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by disruptions in the global economy caused by the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine.The global economy has been negatively impacted by the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine.Furthermore, governments in the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom and European Union have each imposed export controls on certain products and financial and economic sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia. Although we do not have any customers or direct supplier relationships in Russia or Ukraine, businesses globally have experienced shortages in materials and increased costs for transportation, energy, and raw material due in part to the negative impact of the Russia-Ukraine military conflict on the global economy.Further escalation of geopolitical tensions related to the military conflict, including increased trade barriers or restrictions on global trade, could result in, among other things, cyberattacks, supply disruptions, lower consumer demand, and changes to foreign exchange rates and financial markets, any of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We are continuing to monitor the situation in Ukraine and globally and assessing its potential impact on our business. Although our business has not been, to the date of this Annual Report, materially impacted by the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine, it is impossible to predict the extent to which our operations, or those of our suppliers and vendors, will be impacted in the short and long term, or the ways in which the conflict may impact our business.The extent and duration of the military action, sanctions and resulting market disruptions are impossible to predict, but may be substantial.In addition, the effects of the ongoing conflict could heighten any of our known risks described above.ITEM 1B.UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.None.ITEM 1C.CYBERSECURITY.Our cybersecurity processes include:\u2022Basic security awareness online training for personnel with company email, on an annual basis;\u2022Phishing tests for personnel with company email, on not less than an annual basis;\u2022Reviews of certain third-party vendors\u2019 information security programs (as discussed below);\u2022Consultation with external advisors regarding opportunities and enhancements to strengthen our practices and policies, on an ad hoc basis;\u2022Electronic monitoring of the majority of our technology environments to identify cybersecurity events;\u2022Periodic assessments of existing technology hardware configurations, patches, security and lifecycle;\u2022Periodic assessments, in consultation with software providers, of existing software versions, configurations, patches and updates; and\u2022Periodic assessments of data management and handling, including data use and access reviews.Certain information technology general controls are reviewed and tested as part of our internal control over financial reporting.We use third-party services to assist with penetration testing, security incident monitoring, incident response preparation, end point protection, and security awareness online training.Before engaging third-party service providers to whom we grant access to our information technology systems, we may review their information security programs, depending on the feasibility of such review and our assessment of the level of risk the third-party service provider poses to our business operations and our information technology and financial reporting systems. We determine risk level based on a set of internally developed criteria.We do not, however, review the information security programs of all third-party vendors.Where feasible, we also conduct periodic reviews (typically annual) of certain third-party service providers, particularly48Table of Contentsservice providers of financial, financial reporting and accounting systems, depending on our assessment of the level of risk to our business operations and our information technology and financial reporting systems.To date, we are not aware of any cybersecurity incident that has had or is reasonably likely to have a materially adverse effect on our business, including our business strategy, results of operations and financial condition.However, there can be no assurance that our processes and procedures will prevent or timely detect a cybersecurity incident. For more information regarding risks from cybersecurity threats, see the section entitled \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Risks Relating to Our Products\u2014Risks Relating to Production and Distribution of Products.\u201dIn fiscal year 2024, as part of our overall enterprise risk management process, our Board received a report on our program for assessing, monitoring and mitigating cybersecurity risks and has delegated oversight of such program to our Audit Committee.Going forward, the Audit Committee will receive periodic reports on our program for assessing, monitoring and mitigating cybersecurity risks.In addition, as part of its overall responsibility for overseeing the adequacy of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting, our Audit Committee receives periodic reports about our financial reporting information system controls and security.Our Information Systems department, in addition to managing our general information technology systems, is also responsible for managing our enterprise-wide cybersecurity processes. Personnel in our Information System department collectively have decades of experience in information security, information technology and cybersecurity operations.Our Information Systems department monitors, and receives notifications of, potential cybersecurity incidents detected through automated detection and monitoring tools.In the event we discover a material cybersecurity incident, Information Systems personnel reports such incident to our Chief Financial Officer, who then reports to our Chief Executive Officer and the Audit Committee, as appropriate.We do not currently have a Chief Information Security Officer or other senior security officer of a similar title.ITEM 2.PROPERTIES.Our executive offices are located in Toronto, Ontario in Canada, where we lease office space.As of December 31, 2023, the Company owned various manufacturing facilities in Canada and in Hadera, Israel. The Company has announced the pending sale and leaseback of the Peace Naturals Campus and is winding down its operations at the Cronos Fermentation facility in Manitoba and has listed the property for sale.See \u201cOperations and Investments.\u201d Management believes that our existing facilities and the anticipated changes described herein are adequate to meet our current requirements and, to the extent that our facilities are leased, comparable space is readily available.ITEM 3.LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.The Company is subject to various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of its business and in connection with its marketing, distribution and sale of its products.Many of these legal proceedings are in the early stages of litigation and seek damages that are unspecified or not quantified.Although the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not believe these legal proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition but could be material to its results of operations for any particular reporting period depending, in part, on its results for that period. See Part II, Note 10(b) \u201cContingencies,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report for a description of legal proceedings.ITEM 4.MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURE.Not applicable.49Table of ContentsPART IIITEM 5.MARKET FOR REGISTRANT\u2019S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED SHAREHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.Our common shares are traded on Nasdaq and the TSX under the symbol \u201cCRON.\u201dHoldersAs of February 23, 2024, there were approximately 131 holders of record of our common shares.This number of holders of record does not represent the actual number of beneficial owners of our common shares because shares are frequently held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by securities dealers and others for the benefit of individual owners who have the right to vote their shares.DividendsAs of the date of this Annual Report, we have not declared any dividends or made any distributions on our common shares.

With a passion to responsibly elevate the consumer experience, Cronos is building an iconic brand portfolio.Cronos\u2019 diverse international brand portfolio includes Spinach\u00ae, PEACE NATURALS\u00ae and Lord Jones\u00ae.Unless otherwise noted or the context indicates otherwise, references in this Annual Report to the \u201cCompany\u201d, \u201cCronos\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cus\u201d and \u201cour\u201d refer to Cronos Group Inc., its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and, if applicable, its joint ventures and investments accounted for by the equity method; the term \u201ccannabis\u201d means the plant of any species or subspecies of genus Cannabis and any part of that plant, including all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers; the term \u201cU.S.hemp\u201d has the meaning given to the term \u201chemp\u201d in the U.S.Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018, including hemp-derived cannabidiol (\u201cCBD\u201d).StrategyCronos seeks to create value for shareholders by focusing on four core strategic priorities:\u2022growing a portfolio of iconic brands that responsibly elevate the consumer experience;\u2022developing a diversified global sales and distribution network;\u2022establishing an efficient global supply chain; and\u2022creating and monetizing disruptive intellectual property.Discontinued OperationsIn the second quarter of 2023, Cronos exited its U.S. hemp-derived cannabinoid product operations. The exit of the U.S. operations represented a strategic shift that has a major effect on Cronos\u2019 operations and financial results, and as such, qualifies for reporting as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of net loss and comprehensive loss.Prior period amounts have been reclassified to reflect the discontinued operations classification of the U.S. operations.For further detail on the discontinuation of the U.S. operations, see Note 2 \u201cDiscontinued Operations\u201d to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report.52Table of ContentsBusiness SegmentsBeginning in the second quarter of 2023, following the exit of our U.S. operations, Cronos is reporting through one consolidated segment, which includes operations in both Canada and Israel.In Canada, Cronos operates two wholly owned license holder under the Cannabis Act (Canada) (the \u201cCannabis Act\u201d), Peace Naturals Project Inc. (\u201cPeace Naturals\u201d), which has production facilities near Stayner, Ontario (the \u201cPeace Naturals Campus\u201d) and Thanos Holdings Ltd., known as Cronos Fermentation (\u201cCronos Fermentation\u201d), which has a production facility in Winnipeg, Manitoba. In Israel, the Company operates under the IMC-GAP, IMC-GMP and IMC-GDP certifications required for the cultivation, production and marketing of dried flower, pre-rolls and oils in the Israeli medical market.Recent DevelopmentsIsrael-Hamas WarCronos continues to monitor the conflict in Israel (the \u201cIsrael-Hamas War\u201d) and potential impacts the conflict could have on the Company\u2019s personnel and business in Israel and the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities related to the Company\u2019s operations in Israel.The extent to which the conflict may impact the Company\u2019s personnel, business and activities will depend on future developments which remain highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.It is possible that the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities related to the Company\u2019s operations in Israel could change materially in the near term.New Israeli Shekel FluctuationIn October 2023, with the onset of the aforementioned Israel-Hamas war, the New Israeli Shekel has fluctuated significantly against the U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar. As of January 31, 2024, the New Israeli Shekel has weakened to a position of 3.657 per U.S. dollar and a position of 2.729 per Canadian dollar, representing exchange rate increases of 4% and 3%, respectively, from the rates as of September 30, 2023.We cannot predict when or how the currency will fluctuate against the U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar and we have, as a result, experienced a volatile impact on our results of operations.2023 Business HighlightsBrand and Product PortfolioThroughout 2023, the Company expanded its brand and product portfolio globally with the following select new products:Branded Product Portfolio Expansion in Canada:\u2022Q2 2023:\u25e6Spinach FEELZ\u2122 Higher Dayz Mango Kiwi Haze THC:CBC pre-roll, infused with high potency cold filtered extract\u25e6Spinach FEELZ\u2122 Deep Dreamz Blackberry Kush THC:CBN pre-roll, infused with high potency cold filtered extract\u25e6Spinach\u00ae Sonic Lemon fuel 3x0.5g pre-rolls & 3.5g dried flower\u25e6SOURZ by Spinach\u00ae Pink Lemonade gummy\u25e6Spinach\u00ae 28g Frosted Cream Puffs dried flower\u2022Q3 2023:\u25e6Six new Spinach\u00ae 1.2 gram vapes offerings, Peach Punch, Pink Lemonade, Strawberry Slurricane, Wavy Watermelon, Cotton Dandy Kush and Rocket Icicle\u25e6Spinach FEELZ\u00ae Full Tilt Blue Razz Durban THC:THCV vape and Spinach FEELZ\u2122 Full Tilt Blue Raspberry Lemonade THC:THCV gummy products\u25e6Three new Spinach\u00ae Fully Charged infused pre-roll offerings, Peach Punch, Pink Lemonade and Strawberry Slurricane\u25e6Spinach\u00ae Atomic Sour Grapefruit 7g dried flower\u25e6Spinach\u00ae 3.5g Peach Gelato dried flower\u2022Q4 2023:\u25e6Lord Jones\u00ae Hash Fusions\u2122, a line-up of premium ice water hash infused pre-rolls\u25e6SOURZ by Spinach\u00ae Strawberry Kiwi 5:1 CBD:THC 10-pack\u25e6Spinach FEELZ\u2122 Deep Dreamz THC:CBN Drops infused oil\u25e6Spinach\u00ae 14g GMO Cookies dried flower\u25e6Spinach FEELZ\u2122 Full Tilt Blue Razz Durban THC + THCV infused pre-roll53Table of ContentsBranded Product Portfolio Expansion in Israel:\u2022Q1 2023:\u25e6Two new PEACE NATURALS\u00ae flower offerings - Atomic Sour Grapefruit and Lemon Berry Cookies\u2022Q2 2023:\u25e6Two new PEACE NATURALS\u00ae pre-roll offerings - Wedding Rolls and Cocoa Bomba\u2022Q3 2023:\u25e6Five new PEACE NATURALS\u00ae flower offerings - Space Cake, Sticky Ape, Purple Punch, T-twist and Kobe OG\u2022Q4 2023\u25e6Three new PEACE NATURALS\u00ae flower offerings - Rockstar, Dancehall and Sonic FuelInternational Growth:\u2022Q3 2023: Cronos successfully completed its first shipment of PEACE NATURALS\u00ae branded cannabis to Germany through a strategic partnership with Cansativa GmbH, a leading German cannabis company.\u2022Q4 2023: Cronos successfully shipped cannabis flower to Vitura Health Limited for sale in the Australian medical market.Strategic and Organizational UpdateIn May 2023, Cronos simultaneously announced the discontinuation of the U.S. segment and the planned repurposing of the Lord Jones\u00ae brand by bringing the brand back to its adult-use roots in Canada. We launched the Lord Jones\u00ae brand in Canada in the fourth quarter of 2023.In August 2023, following a careful evaluation of the Company\u2019s global supply chain, the Company announced the planned wind-down of Thanos Holdings Ltd., known as Cronos Fermentation.The Company incurred $0.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, related to the wind-down of Cronos Fermentation and expects to incur charges of approximately $0.1 million of additional costs in connection with the ongoing exit.These charges include employee-related costs, such as severance, relocation and other termination benefits, as well as contract termination and other related costs.Cronos expects to continue to operate the Cronos Fermentation facility with a phased reduction and planned exit by the end of the first quarter 2024.Also in August 2023, the Company announced organization-wide cost reductions. The Company incurred $0.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, related to the cost reductions and expects to incur additional restructuring costs of approximately $0.1 million in connection with the cost reductions, which include mostly one-time employee-related severance charges.In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company entered into an agreement for the sale and leaseback of the Peace Naturals Campus for an aggregate purchase price of C$23 million in cash, subject to certain terms and conditions.At closing the parties expect to enter into a lease agreement with respect to portions of Building 4 and Building 3 on the Peace Naturals Campus.The lease will have an initial term of five years with one five-year renewal option that may be exercised by the Company.2022 Compared to 2021Cash FlowsFor a discussion of our 2022 cash flows compared to 2021, see Part II, Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.Foreign currency exchange ratesAll currency amounts in this Annual Report are stated in U.S. dollars, which is our reporting currency, unless otherwise noted. All references to \u201cdollars\u201d or \u201c$\u201d are to U.S. dollars.The assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into dollars at the exchange rate in effect as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, as reported on Bloomberg.Transactions affecting the shareholders\u2019 equity (deficit) are translated at historical foreign exchange rates.The consolidated statements of net loss and comprehensive loss and consolidated statements of cash flows of our foreign operations are translated into dollars by applying the average foreign exchange rate in effect for the years ended December 31, 2023, December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, as reported on Bloomberg.The exchange rates used to translate from Canadian dollars (\u201cC$\u201d) to dollars are shown below:##table 4##54Table of ContentsThe exchange rates used to translate from New Israeli Shekels (\u201cILS\u201d) to dollars are shown below:##table 5##Consolidated Results of Operations - 2023 Compared to 2022The tables below set forth our consolidated results of operations, expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars for the periods presented. Our consolidated financial results for these periods are not necessarily indicative of the consolidated financial results that we will achieve in future periods.##table 6##Summary of select financial results##table 7##(i)Gross margin is defined as gross profit divided by net revenue.55Table of ContentsNet revenueFor 2023, we reported consolidated net revenue of $87.2 million, representing a $0.5 million increase from 2022.This change was primarily due to higher cannabis flower and extract sales in the Canadian adult-use market and the initiation of sales in Germany and Australia, partially offset by lower cannabis flower sales in Israel driven by pricing pressure as a result of competitive activity, the slowdown in patient permit authorizations and the Israel-Hamas War, an adverse price/mix in the Canadian cannabis flower category driving increased excise tax payments as a percentage of revenue, and the impact of the weakened Canadian dollar and New Israeli Shekel against the U.S. dollar during the period.Cost of salesFor 2023, we reported consolidated cost of sales of $74.5 million, representing a $3.2 million increase from 2022. This was primarily due to higher cannabis flower and extract sales in the Canadian adult-use market, partially offset by lower cannabis flower sales in the Israeli medical market, lower inventory reserves, lower cannabis biomass costs and the impact of the weakened Canadian dollar and New Israeli Shekel against the U.S. dollar during the period.Inventory write-downFor 2023, we reported inventory write-downs of $0.8 million, as a result of the Company\u2019s decision to wind down operations at a production facility in Winnipeg, Manitoba, held by license holder Cronos Fermentation.For further information, see Note 16 \u201cRestructuring\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.Gross profitFor 2023, we reported consolidated gross profit of $11.9 million, representing a $3.5 million decrease from 2022. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to lower cannabis flower sales in the Israeli medical market, an adverse price/mix on cannabis flower sales in Canada resulting in higher excise taxes as a percentage of revenue and the inventory write-down recognized as a result of the decision to wind down operations at Cronos Fermentation, partially offset by higher cannabis flower and extract sales in the Canadian adult-use market.Operating expenses##table 8##Sales and marketingFor 2023, we reported sales and marketing expenses of $22.7 million, representing an increase of $4.7 million from 2022.The increase was primarily due to higher advertising and marketing spend.Research and developmentFor 2023, we reported research and development expenses of $5.8 million, representing a decrease of $7.3 million from 2022. This decrease was primarily due to lower costs associated with the collaboration and license agreement between Ginkgo Bioworks Holdings, Inc. (\u201cGinkgo\u201d) and the Company (the \u201cGinkgo Collaboration Agreement\u201d).General and administrativeFor 2023, we reported general and administrative expenses of $49.5 million, representing a decrease of $18.2 million from 2022.The decrease was primarily due to lower professional fees, largely related to lower financial statement review costs, and lower bonus, payroll and insurance costs.Restructuring costsFor 2023, we reported restructuring costs of $1.5 million, representing a decrease of $2.0 million from 2022.The restructuring costs in 2023 and 2022 were related to Realignment activities.For further information, see Note 16 \u201cRestructuring\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.56Table of ContentsShare-based compensationFor 2023, we reported share-based compensation expenses of $8.8 million, representing a decrease of $6.3 million from 2022. The decrease was primarily due to the 2022 acceleration of expense on equity awards granted to certain executive employees in connection with their separation from the Company as well as the approval of the grant of previously held-back equity awards granted in 2022 to certain executives in connection with the settlements with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) and the Ontario Securities Commission (the \u201cOSC\u201d).For further information, see Note 11 \u201cShare-based Compensation\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.Depreciation and amortizationFor 2023, depreciation and amortization expenses were $5.0 million, representing a decrease of $0.9 million from 2022.The decrease was primarily due to the recognition of certain tax credits related to the Company\u2019s fixed assets, partially offset by higher amortization on Ginkgo-related intangible assets.Impairment loss on long-lived assetsDuring 2023, we recorded a $3.4 million impairment charge related to our Ginkgo exclusive license for cannabichromevarinic acid (\u201cCBCVA\u201d). For 2022, we recorded $3.5 million of impairment charges related to the right-of-use lease asset and leasehold improvements associated with our corporate headquarters in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, which the Company has subleased in part.See Note 7 \u201cGoodwill and Intangible Assets, net\u201d, Note 6 \u201cProperty, plant and equipment, net\u201d and Note 8 \u201cLeases\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information.Total other income, income tax benefit (expense) and loss from discontinued operations##table 9##(i)\u201cN/M\u201d is defined as not meaningful.Interest income, netFor 2023, we reported interest income, net of $51.2 million, representing an increase of $28.7 million from 2022 primarily due to higher interest rates and higher short-term investment balances during 2023.Gain (loss) on revaluation of derivative liabilitiesFor 2023, we reported a loss on revaluation of derivative liabilities of $0.1 million, representing a change of $14.1 million compared to a gain in 2022 related to the irrevocable relinquishment by Altria of its warrant on December 16, 2022. We expect continued changes in derivative valuations as our share price fluctuates period to period and the remaining expected terms of our derivative instruments change over time.For further information, see Note 9 \u201cDerivative Liabilities\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.Impairment loss on other investmentsFor 2023, we recognized $23.4 million of impairment loss on other investments, driven by an impairment charge recorded on our PharmaCann Option for the difference between its estimated fair value and its carrying amount.For 2022, impairment loss on other investments was $61.4 million, driven by impairment charges recorded on our PharmaCann Option for the difference between its estimated fair value and its carrying amount.For more information, see Note 4 \u201cInvestments\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.57Table of ContentsShare of income from equity method investmentsFor 2023, we reported share of income from equity method investments of $1.6 million, representing a decrease of $1.5 million from 2022. The decrease was primarily due to lower income pick-ups from our equity method investment in Cronos GrowCo.Periodic income and loss pickups from our equity method investment in Cronos GrowCo are impacted both by the profitability of Cronos GrowCo and any unsold inventory remaining at Cronos at the end of the period that originated from Cronos GrowCo.Gain (loss) on revaluation of financial instrumentsFor 2023, we reported a loss on revaluation of financial instruments of $12.0 million, compared to a gain of $14.7 million in 2022.The change was due to the change in fair value of our investment in Vitura.See Note 4 \u201cInvestments\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information.Foreign currency transaction lossFor 2023, foreign currency transaction loss was $7.3 million, representing an increased loss of $5.0 million from 2022. The change was primarily due to certain foreign currency-denominated cash equivalents and short-term investments and certain foreign currency-denominated intercompany loans anticipated to be settled in the foreseeable future.Other, netFor 2023, other, net was income of $1.1 million, compared to a loss of $0.3 million in 2022.The change was primarily driven by gains on the disposal of assets.Income tax benefit (expense)For 2023, we reported an income tax benefit of $3.2 million, compared to an income tax expense of $34.2 million in 2022.The change was due primarily to a capital gain for tax purposes of $479.8 million, which resulted in an income tax liability of $34.2 million, related to the irrevocable relinquishment by Altria of the Warrant on December 16, 2022.Loss from discontinued operations##table 10##For 2023, we reported a loss from discontinued operations of $4.1 million, compared to a loss from discontinued operations of $13.6 million in 2022. The decreased loss was driven by the decrease in operating expenses as a result of the exit of U.S. operations in the second quarter of 2023.See Note 2 \u201cDiscontinued Operations\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information.58Table of ContentsConsolidated Results of Operations - 2022 Compared to 2021The tables below set forth our consolidated results of operations, expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars for the periods presented.Our consolidated financial results for these periods are not necessarily indicative of the consolidated financial results that we will achieve in future periods.##table 11##Summary of select financial results##table 12##(i)Gross margin is defined as gross profit divided by net revenue.Net revenueFor 2022, we reported consolidated net revenue of $86.7 million, representing a $22.2 million increase from 2021. This change was primarily due to higher cannabis flower sales in the Israeli medical market and higher cannabis extract sales in the Canadian adult-use market, partially offset by lower cannabis flower sales in the Canadian adult-use market driven by an unfavorable price/mix shift and the impact of the weakening Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar during 2022.59Table of ContentsCost of salesFor 2022, we reported consolidated cost of sales of $71.3 million, representing a $1.1 million increase from 2021, despite a 34% increase in net revenue.This was primarily due to lower cannabis biomass costs and the impact of the weakening Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar during the period, partially offset by higher sales volumes and lower fixed cost absorption due to the timing of the wind-down of cultivation and certain production activities associated with the change in the nature of operations at the Peace Naturals Campus.Inventory write-downFor 2021, we reported inventory write-downs of $12.0 million, primarily related to cannabis strains and potency levels that were no longer in-line with consumer preferences in the Canadian market and adjustments for obsolete inventory in Canada. We reported no inventory write-downs for 2022.Gross profitFor 2022, we reported consolidated gross profit of $15.4 million, representing a $33.0 million improvement from 2021.The improvement in gross profit is primarily due to increased revenue driven mainly by a favorable mix of cannabis extract products, which carry a higher gross profit and gross margin than other product categories, higher sales of cannabis flower in Israel, the absence of inventory write-downs in 2022, and lower cannabis biomass costs, partially offset by lower fixed cost absorption due to the timing of the wind-down of cultivation and certain production activities associated with the change in the nature of operations at the Peace Naturals Campus.Operating expenses##table 13##Sales and marketingFor 2022, we reported sales and marketing expenses of $18.0 million, representing a decrease of $2.9 million from 2021. The decrease was primarily due to lower advertising and marketing spend.Research and developmentFor 2022, we reported research and development expenses of $13.1 million, representing a decrease of $8.7 million from 2021.This decrease was primarily due to lower costs associated with the Ginkgo Collaboration Agreement.General and administrativeFor 2022, we reported general and administrative expenses of $67.7 million, representing a decrease of $23.2 million from 2021.The decrease was primarily due to lower expected credit losses on our loans to joint venture partners when compared to 2021, lower legal and advisory fees associated with strategic initiatives and lower personnel-related costs associated with the Realignment.Restructuring costsFor 2022, we reported restructuring costs of $3.5 million, compared to no restructuring costs in 2021. The restructuring costs in 2022 were related to Realignment activities.For further information, see Note 16 \u201cRestructuring\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.60Table of ContentsShare-based compensationFor 2022, we reported share-based compensation expenses of $15.0 million, representing an increase of $5.2 million from 2021.The increase was primarily due to the acceleration of expense on equity awards granted to certain executive employees in connection with their separation from the Company as well as the approval of the grant of previously held-back equity awards granted to certain executives in connection with the SEC and OSC settlements.For further information, see Note 11 \u201cShare-based Compensation\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.Depreciation and amortizationFor 2022, depreciation and amortization expenses were $6.0 million, representing an increase of $1.6 million from 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher amortization on our Ginkgo exclusive license intangible assets.Impairment loss on goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assetsFor 2021, we reported impairment loss on goodwill and intangible assets of $37 thousand due to impairment charges on our PEACE+\u2122 trademark.For 2022, we reported no such impairment losses.For further information, see Note 7 \u201cGoodwill and Intangible Assets, net\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.Impairment loss on long-lived assetsDuring 2022, we recorded impairment charges of $3.5 million related to the right-of-use lease asset and leasehold improvements associated with our corporate headquarters in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, which the Company has subleased in part.For 2021, we recorded an impairment charge of $119.9 million on long-lived assets related to the previously announced planned exit from the Peace Naturals Campus. Additionally, in 2021, we recorded impairment charges of $4.8 million related to our Ginkgo exclusive licenses for cannabigerolic acid (\u201cCBGA\u201d) and cannabigerovarinic acid (\u201cCBGVA\u201d) for the difference between the fair value of the licenses and the consideration paid.See Note 6 \u201cProperty, plant and equipment, net\u201d, Note 7 \u201cGoodwill and Intangible Assets, net\u201d and Note 8 \u201cLeases\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information.Total other income, income tax benefit (expense) and loss from discontinued operations##table 14##(i)\u201cN/M\u201d is defined as not meaningful.Interest income, netFor 2022, we reported interest income, net of $22.5 million, representing an increase of $13.4 million from 2021 primarily due to higher short-term investment balances and higher interest rates in 2022 when compared to 2021.Gain on revaluation of derivative liabilitiesFor 2022, we reported a gain on revaluation of derivative liabilities of $14.1 million, representing a decrease of $137.3 million from 2021 primarily due to the greater impact on the derivative liabilities in 2021 from the decreased estimated term of the derivative instruments and the decreased price of Cronos common shares.Impairment loss on other investmentsFor 2022, impairment loss on other investments was $61.4 million, driven by impairment charges recorded on our PharmaCann Option for the difference between its estimated fair value and its carrying amount. There were no such impairment losses on other investments during 2021.For more information, see Note 4 \u201cInvestments\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.61Table of ContentsShare of income (loss) from equity method investmentsFor 2022, we reported share of income from equity method investments of $3.1 million, representing an increase of $9.4 million from 2021.The change was primarily due to improved results from our equity method investment in Cronos GrowCo.Gain (loss) on revaluation of financial instrumentsFor 2022, we reported a gain on revaluation of financial instruments of $14.7 million, representing an increase of $6.1 million from 2021.The increase was due to the change in fair value of our investment in Vitura.See Note 4 \u201cInvestments\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information.Foreign currency transaction lossFor 2022, foreign currency transaction loss was $2.3 million, which related to certain foreign currency-denominated intercompany loans anticipated to be settled in the foreseeable future. There were no such foreign currency transaction gains or losses during 2021.Other, netFor 2022, other, net was a loss of $0.3 million, compared to income of $0.7 million in 2021.The change was primarily due to loss on disposal of assets associated with the Realignment, partially offset by $0.4 million of dividend income from our Vitura investment during 2022.Income tax benefit (expense)For 2022, we reported income tax expense of $34.2 million, compared to an income tax benefit of $0.4 million in 2021.The change was due primarily to a capital gain for tax purposes of $479.8 million, which resulted in an income tax liability of $34.2 million, related to the irrevocable relinquishment by Altria of its warrant on December 16, 2022.Loss from discontinued operations##table 15##For 2022, we reported loss from discontinued operations of $13.6 million, compared to a loss from discontinued operations of $269.1 million in 2021. The decreased loss was driven by the $236.0 impairment loss on goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2021.See Note 2 \u201cDiscontinued Operations\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information.62Table of ContentsNon-GAAP MeasuresCronos reports its financial results in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (\u201cU.S.GAAP\u201d).This Annual Report refers to measures not recognized under U.S. GAAP (\u201cnon-GAAP measures\u201d).These non-GAAP measures do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.Rather, these non-GAAP measures are provided as a supplement to corresponding U.S. GAAP measures to provide additional information regarding our results of operations from management\u2019s perspective. Accordingly, non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.All non-GAAP measures presented in this Annual Report are reconciled to their closest reported U.S. GAAP measure.Reconciliations of historical adjusted financial measures to corresponding U.S. GAAP measures are provided below.Adjusted EBITDAManagement reviews Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, which excludes non-cash items and items that do not reflect management\u2019s assessment of ongoing business performance.Management defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization adjusted for: share of (income) loss from equity method investments; impairment loss on goodwill and intangible assets; impairment loss on long-lived assets; (gain) loss on revaluation of derivative liabilities; (gain) loss on revaluation of financial instruments; transaction costs related to strategic projects; impairment loss on other investments; foreign currency transaction loss; other, net; loss from discontinued operations; restructuring costs; inventory write-downs resulting from restructuring actions; share-based compensation; and financial statement review costs and reserves related to the restatements of our 2019 and 2021 interim financial statements (the \u201cRestatements\u201d), including the costs related to the settlement of the SEC\u2019s and the OSC\u2019s investigations of the Restatements and legal costs defending shareholder class action complaints brought against us as a result of the 2019 restatement (see Note 10(b) \u201cContingencies,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report for a discussion of the shareholder class action complaints relating to the restatement of the 2019 interim financial statements and the settlement of the SEC\u2019s and the OSC\u2019s investigations of the Restatements). Results are reported as total consolidated results, reflecting our reporting structure of one reportable segment.Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides the most useful insight into underlying business trends and results and provides a more meaningful comparison of period-over-period results.Management uses Adjusted EBITDA for planning, forecasting and evaluating business and financial performance, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to employee compensation targets.Adjusted EBITDA is reconciled to net loss as follows:##table 16##63Table of Contents##table 17####table 18##(i)For the year ended December 31, 2021, impairment loss on goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets relates primarily to impairment on goodwill and intangible assets related to our U.S. operations.

We present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying operations performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations.To present this information, current and prior period income statement results in currencies other than U.S. dollars are converted into U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates from the comparative period in 2022 rather than the actual average exchange rates in effect during 2023; constant currency current period balance sheet information is translated at the prior year-end spot rate rather than the current year-end spot rate.All growth comparisons relate to the corresponding period in 2022.We have provided this non-GAAP financial information to aid investors in better understanding the performance of our business. The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this Annual Report should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.The table below sets forth certain measures of consolidated results from continuing operations on an as-reported and constant currency basis for 2023 compared to 2022, as well as cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2023, compared to December 31, 2022, on an as-reported and constant currency basis (in thousands):##table 19##65Table of ContentsNet revenue##table 20####table 21##Net RevenueFor 2023, net revenue on a constant currency basis was $91.7 million, representing a 6% increase from 2022.Net revenue increased on a constant currency basis primarily due to higher cannabis flower and extracts sales in the Canadian adult-use market, partially offset by lower cannabis flower sales in Israel driven by pricing pressure as a result of competitive activity, the slowdown in patient permit authorizations and the Israel-Hamas War, and an adverse price/mix in Canada in the cannabis flower category driving increased excise tax payments as a percentage of revenue.Gross profitFor 2023, gross profit on a constant currency basis was $12.7 million, representing an 18% decrease from 2022. Gross profit decreased on a constant currency basis primarily due to lower cannabis flower sales in the Israeli medical market, an adverse price/mix on cannabis flower sales in Canada resulting in higher excise taxes as a percentage of revenue and the inventory write-down recognized as a result of the decision to wind down operations at Cronos Fermentation, partially offset by higher cannabis flower and extract sales in the Canadian adult-use market.Operating expensesFor 2023, operating expenses on a constant currency basis was $101.1 million, representing a 20% decrease from 2022.Operating expenses decreased on a constant currency basis primarily due to lower professional fees, largely related to financial statement review costs, lower costs associated with the achievement of Ginkgo milestones, the 2022 acceleration of expense on equity awards granted to certain executive employees in connection with their separation from the Company, as well as previously held-back equity awards granted in 2022 to certain executives, impairment loss on long-lived assets recognized in the prior year, lower bonus expense, lower payroll costs and lower insurance costs, partially offset by higher sales and marketing expenses.Net lossFor 2023, net loss on a constant currency basis was $73.2 million, representing a 53% improvement from 2022.Adjusted EBITDAFor 2023, Adjusted EBITDA on a constant currency basis was $64.5 million, representing an 8% improvement from 2022. Adjusted EBITDA increased on a constant currency basis primarily due to higher cannabis flower and extracts sales in the Canadian adult-use market, decreases in general and administrative expenses and lower costs associated with the achievement of Ginkgo milestones, partially offset by lower cannabis flower sales in Israel driven by pricing pressure as a result of competitive activity, the slowdown in patient permit authorizations and the Israel-Hamas War, an adverse price/mix in Canada in the cannabis flower category driving increased excise tax payments as a percentage of revenue and higher sales and marketing expenses.Cash and cash equivalents & short-term investmentsCash and cash equivalents and short-term investments on a constant currency basis decreased 4% to $844.5 million as of December 31, 2023 from $877.7 million as of December 31, 2022. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments is primarily due to cash flows used in operating activities in 2023.66Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund our business operations and capital expenditures over the next twelve months.Our primary need for liquidity is to fund operations and capital expenditures.Our ability to fund operations and capital expenditures depends on, among other things, future operating performance and cash flows that are subject to general economic conditions and financial and other factors, including factors beyond our control.Since 2019, we have been funded by the C$2.4 billion (approximately $1.8 billion) Altria investment in us as further discussed under \u201cBusiness\u2014Altria Strategic Investment\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report. As of December 31, 2023, we had $669.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $192.2 million in short term investments, compared to $764.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $113.1 million in short term investments as of December 31, 2022.As of both December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had no external financing.Cash flows##table 22##2023 cash flows vs 2022 cash flowsOperating activitiesDuring 2023, we used $42.8 million of cash in operating activities, compared to $88.9 million in 2022, representing a decrease in cash used of $46.1 million.This change is primarily driven by an $88.3 million increase in net income after adjusting for non-cash items, such as impairment charges, share-based payments, depreciation and amortization, and share of loss from investments in equity method investments, partially offset by and a net decrease in changes in operating assets and liabilities of $42.2 million related to payments for income taxes, the timing of collections of receivables, payments for accruals and payables, and purchases of inventory.Investing activitiesDuring 2023, we used $59.5 million of cash in investing activities, compared to $1.8 million during 2022, representing an increase of $57.7 million in net cash used. This change is primarily driven by higher net purchases of short-term investments, partially offset by higher net repayments on loan receivables and lower purchases of property, plant and equipment.Financing activitiesDuring 2023, cash used in financing activities was $1.0 million, as compared to $2.9 million in 2022, representing a decrease in net cash used of $1.9 million.This change is primarily driven by a decrease in withholding taxes paid on share-based awards.Cash requirementsIn the near term, we expect to use our available cash and investments to operate our core business and develop new ways to serve our customers as well as invest in our various strategic partnerships and in our investees.We believe we have adequate liquidity to meet working capital requirements.Our material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2023:LeasesWe have operating leases for land, buildings and office space. As of December 31, 2023, the future minimum payments required under these leases totaled $3.0 million, with $1.1 million payable within 12 months.Refer to Note 8 \u201cLeases\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further information.Loans receivable with related partiesWe have entered into three loan agreements with affiliates.As of December 31, 2023, Cronos GrowCo had approximately $0.8 million undrawn on its credit facility, with no amounts expected to be drawn within 12 months.The Mucci Promissory Note and Cannasoul Collaboration Loan (each as defined below) have been fully drawn.Refer to Note 5 \u201cLoans Receivable, net\u201d to the consolidated financial statement in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further information.67Table of ContentsPurchase obligationsOur purchase obligations primarily consist of contractual obligations to maintain the ordinary course of business through information technology and capital expenditures related to computer software, agricultural supply services and data analytics. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had purchase obligations of $13.0 million, with $10.1 million payable within 12 months.Other purchase obligations consist of noncancellable obligations related to maintenance, internet, and telecommunication service.As of December 31, 2023, we had other purchase obligations of $4.4 million, with $2.2 million payable within 12 months.Critical Accounting EstimatesEstimates and critical judgments by managementThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates are reviewed periodically, and adjustments are made as appropriate in the year they become known.Items for which actual results may differ materially from these estimates are described in the following section.Refer to Note 1 \u201cBackground, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further information on our critical accounting estimates and policies, which are as follows:Revenue recognitionRevenue is recognized at the point in time when the control of the promised goods is transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for the performance obligation.Excise taxes remitted to tax authorities are government-imposed excise taxes on cannabis products. Excise taxes are recorded as a reduction of sales in net revenue in the consolidated statements of income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized as a current liability within accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, with the liability subsequently reduced when the taxes are remitted to the tax authority.In addition, amounts disclosed as net revenue are net of allowances, discounts and rebates.In determining the transaction price for the sale of goods, the Company considers the effects of variable consideration and the existence of significant financing components, if any.Some contracts for the sale of goods may provide customers with a right of return, most-favored-customer rights, or early payment discounts.In addition, the Company may provide, in certain circumstances, a retroactive price reduction to a customer based primarily on inventory movement. These items give rise to variable consideration.The Company uses the expected value method to estimate the variable consideration because this method best predicts the amount of variable consideration to which the Company will be entitled.The Company uses historical evidence, current information and forecasts to estimate the variable consideration.The Company reduces revenue and recognizes a contract liability equal to the amount expected to be refunded to the customer in the form of a future rebate or credit for a retroactive price reduction, representing its obligation to return the customer\u2019s consideration.The estimate is updated at each reporting period date.Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assetsGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization.We test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that could indicate a potential impairment. We compare the fair value of our reporting units with their carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit\u2019s fair value.We believe that the accounting estimate for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets is a critical accounting estimate because of the judgment required in assessing the fair value of each of our reporting units.We estimate fair value through various valuation methods, including the use of discounted expected future cash flows of each reporting unit, as well as the use of the relief-from-royalty method on the Lord Jones\u00ae brand.Significant inputs include discount rates, growth rates, and cash flow projections, and, for the Lord Jones\u00ae brand, royalty rate.These valuation inputs are considered Level 3 inputs as defined by Accounting Standards Codification 820 Fair Value Measurement. The expected future cash flows for each reporting unit are significantly impacted by current market conditions.If these market conditions and resulting expected future cash flows for each reporting unit decline significantly, the actual results for each reporting unit could differ from our estimate, which would cause goodwill to be impaired.Our accounting for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets represents our best estimate of future events.68Table of ContentsInventory valuationWe value our inventory at lower of cost or net realizable value determined using weighted average cost.Inventory is reflected at the lower of cost or net realizable value considering future demand, market conditions and market prices.Our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. These valuations require the use of management\u2019s assumptions that do not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur.We record an inventory valuation adjustment for excess, slow moving, and obsolete inventory that is equal to the excess of the cost of the inventory over the estimated net realizable value.We also experience inventory write-downs due to reduced market prices.The inventory valuation adjustment to net realizable value establishes a new cost basis of the inventory that cannot be subsequently reversed.Inventory valuation adjustments are based on inventory levels, expected product life, and estimated product demand.In assessing the ultimate realization of inventories, we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements compared with inventory levels.Long-lived assetsLong-lived assets are primarily comprised of property, plant, and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets. We evaluate long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in management\u2019s judgment, that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.Long-lived asset recoverability is assessed on an asset group basis.We group assets and liabilities for our asset groups at the reporting unit level, which is the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable.Long-lived asset recoverability is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group with its estimated future undiscounted pre-tax cash flows over the remaining life of the primary long-lived asset of the asset group.If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows as part of the recoverability assessment, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset group. The impairment charge is allocated to the underlying long-lived assets in the asset group on a relative carrying amount basis; however, carrying amount after allocated impairment is subject to a floor of fair value on an individual asset basis.We believe the accounting estimates used in the long-lived asset impairment assessment are critical accounting estimates because of the judgment required in identifying indicators of impairment, determining asset groups, assessing future undiscounted cash flows of the asset groups, and as applicable, evaluating the fair value of the determined asset groups as well as the underlying long-lived assets, once indicators of impairment have been identified.We periodically evaluate whether impairment indicators related to our property, plant and equipment, operating leases and other long-lived assets are present. These impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset or asset group, early termination of an operating lease, a significant adverse change to the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition, or a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset or asset group.If impairment indicators are present, we estimate the fair value for the asset or group of assets.We estimate fair value of long-lived assets through various valuation methods, including the use of the indirect cost approach, income approach, and direct comparison approach.The indirect cost approach is based on the estimated cost to reproduce the asset as if new, adjusted for physical deterioration and consideration of functional and economic obsolescence. The income approach is based on estimated rental and capitalization rates.The direct comparison approach is based on recent observable transactions of comparable assets.The estimation of future undiscounted cash flows of the asset groups as well as each of these fair value approaches are significantly impacted by market conditions.A significant adverse change in market conditions could result in fair values that differ from our estimates, which could adversely impact whether an impairment exists and the extent to which an asset group and underlying assets are impaired.The difference between the fair value and the carrying amount of the asset group is recorded as an impairment charge.Refer to Note 6 \u201cProperty, plant and equipment, net\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.We periodically evaluate our long-lived assets that we plan to dispose of through sale for held-for-sale classification. To be classified as held-for-sale, management must have committed to a plan to sell, the asset (or asset group) must be available for immediate sale in its present condition, an active program to locate a buyer must have been initiated, the sale must be probable to close within one year, the asset (or asset group) must be marketed at a reasonable sales price, and it must be unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made.Once an asset (or asset group) meets all of the above criteria, it is reclassified as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet, and the asset(s) cease depreciation and are written down to their fair value, less costs to sell, if applicable.The Company completed a review of its global supply chain and determined that it would wind down the Cronos Fermentation facility and list it for sale. This review involves significant complexities and judgments in making the accounting treatment determination.There are subjective and complex judgments in the determination of whether the Cronos Fermentation facility meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, including: (1) whether the Cronos Fermentation facility is available for sale in its present condition subject only\u2002to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such businesses, (2) whether the sale of the Cronos Fermentation facility is probable and that the transfer of assets will be a completed sale within one year from period end, and (3) whether the Cronos Fermentation facility is being actively marketed at a reasonable price.See Note 6 \u201cProperty, plant and equipment, net\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for discussion regarding our evaluation of the Peace Naturals Campus and the Cronos Fermentation facility for held-for-sale classification as of December 31, 2023.69Table of ContentsWe account for the cannabinoid exclusive licenses originating from the Ginkgo Strategic Partnership as definite-lived intangible assets in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting. The cost of cash and equity in Cronos issued in exchange for the cannabinoid exclusive licenses is initially recognized and measured at the date of acquisition.On the date of acquisition, we then test each cannabinoid exclusive license for impairment by comparing the cost and fair value of each license.We believe that the accounting estimate for the cannabinoid exclusive licenses is a critical accounting estimate because of the judgment required in assessing their fair values and the expected future cash flows are significantly impacted by the future expectations for products containing each cannabinoid.We estimate the fair value using the relief-from-royalty method.Each cannabinoid exclusive license is subject to amortization.Refer to Note 7 \u201cGoodwill and Intangible Assets, net\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.Valuation of derivative liabilitiesPrior to December 16, 2022, derivative liabilities consisted of the warrant issued to Altria, as well as Altria\u2019s pre-emptive rights, and certain top-up rights. On December 16, 2022, Altria notified us that its wholly owned subsidiary, Altria Summit LLC, irrevocably relinquished its warrant and all rights that it may have held in the warrant or any common shares underlying the warrant for no consideration.As of December 31, 2023, derivative liabilities consisted of pre-emptive rights and certain top-up rights.We measure derivative liabilities at fair value at each reporting date until settlement with the re-measurement gain or loss being recognized immediately in net loss and comprehensive loss.We calculate fair value of the derivative liabilities using the Black-Scholes model.Significant assumptions are used in the valuation of derivative liabilities, including the expected term and our stock price.The assumptions used in computing the fair value of derivative liabilities reflect our best estimates, but involve uncertainties relating to market and other conditions, many of which are outside of our control. Sensitivity is performed on various inputs, refer to Note 9 \u201cDerivative Liabilities\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.Impairment of other investments without readily determinable fair valuesWe hold other investments without readily determinable fair values that are measured under the cost method less impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same investee.Each reporting period, we qualitatively assess if indicators of impairment are present, and, if present, we estimate the fair value of the investments and record impairment charges on the consolidated statements of income if the carrying value exceeds fair value.To estimate the fair value of the investments, we use a combination of the income and market approaches. Under the income approach, significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow method that require the use of judgment are the discount rate, growth rates, cash flow projections, and the expectation of federal rescheduling and individual state legalization of cannabis in the U.S.Under the market valuation approach, the key assumptions that require judgment under the Guideline Public Companies method are cash flow projections, selected multiples and the discount for lack of marketability.Share-based compensationWe measure the fair value of services received in exchange for all stock options granted based on the fair market value of the award as of the grant date.We compute the fair value of stock options with time-based vesting using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and recognize the cost of the equity awards over the period that services are provided to earn the award. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields, expected volatility, expected option term and risk-free interest rates.The assumptions used in computing the fair value of share-based compensation expense reflect our best estimates, but involve uncertainties relating to market and other conditions, many of which are outside of our control.We estimate expected volatility based primarily on historical daily price changes of our stock and peers.The expected option term is the number of years that we estimate that the stock options will be outstanding prior to exercise.Loans receivable, netLoans receivable are presented net of an allowance for credit losses.The probability of default rate is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future losses as necessary. We may also record a specific reserve for individual accounts when we become aware of specific customer circumstances, such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing or deterioration in the borrower\u2019s operating results or financial condition.Assets held for saleWe periodically evaluate our long-lived assets that we plan to dispose of through sale for held-for-sale classification.To be classified as held-for-sale, management must have committed to a plan to sell, the asset (or asset group) must be available for immediate sale in its present condition, an active program to locate a buyer must have been initiated, the sale must be probable to close within one year, the asset (or asset group) must be marketed at a reasonable sales price, and it must be unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made. Once an asset (or asset group) meets all of the above criteria, it is reclassified as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet, and the asset(s) cease depreciation and are written down to their fair value, less costs to sell, if applicable.See Note 6 \u201cProperty, plant and equipment, net\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for discussion regarding our evaluation of the Peace Naturals Campus and the Cronos Fermentation facility for held-for-sale classification as of December 31, 2023.70Table of ContentsITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.Interest rate riskInterest rate risk is the risk that the value or yield of fixed-income investments may decline if interest rates change.Fluctuations in interest rates may impact the level of income and expense recorded on the cash equivalents and short-term investments, and the market value of all interest-earning assets, other than those which possess a short term to maturity. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had interest income, net of $51.2 million and $22.5 million, respectively.A 10% change in the interest rate in effect on December 31, 2023 would not have a material effect on the fair value of our cash equivalents and short-term investments as the majority of the portfolio had a maturity date of three months or less.A 10% change in the interest rate in effect for 2023 would have an effect of $5.4 million on interest income, net earned on our cash equivalents, short-term investments.A 10% change in the interest rate in effect on December 31, 2022, would not have a material effect on (i) fair value of the cash equivalents and short-term investments as the majority of the portfolio had a maturity date of three months or less, or (ii) interest income, net. Management continues to monitor external interest rates and revise our investment strategy as a result.During the year ended December 31, 2023, our average variable interest rate increased by approximately 1.45%.During the year ended December 31, 2022, our average variable interest rate did not materially change.Foreign currency riskOur consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report are expressed in U.S. dollars.In addition, we have net assets, liabilities, and revenues denominated in foreign currencies, including Canadian dollars and Israeli new shekels.As a result, we are exposed to foreign currency translation gains and losses.Revenue and expenses of all foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the foreign currency exchange rates that approximate the rates in effect during the period when such items are recognized. Appreciating foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar will adversely impact operating income and net earnings, while depreciating foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar will have a positive impact.For the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had foreign currency gain (loss) on translation of $21.5 million and $(50.6) million, respectively.A 10% change in the exchange rates for the Canadian dollar would affect the carrying amount of the net assets by approximately $97.7 million and $77.4 million as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.The corresponding impact would be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.We have not historically engaged in hedging transactions and do not currently contemplate engaging in hedging transactions to mitigate foreign exchange risks. As we continue to recognize gains and losses in foreign currency transactions, depending upon changes in future currency rates, such gains and losses could have a significant, and potentially adverse, effect on our results of operations.71Table of ContentsITEM 8.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA##table 23##72Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Shareholders and Board of DirectorsCronos Group Inc.:Opinion on the Consolidated Financial StatementsWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cronos Group Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of net loss and comprehensive loss, changes in shareholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three\u2011year period ended December 31, 2023 and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three\u2011year period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 29, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.Basis for OpinionThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relateValuation of an option to purchase equity securities without a readily determinable fair valueAs disclosed in note 1(g) of the consolidated financial statements, the Company records its other investments without a readily determinable fair value using the cost method and assesses such investments for observable price changes and other than temporary impairment on a periodic basis.Changes in the reported value of other investments are reported in the consolidated statements of net loss and comprehensive loss. As disclosed in note 4(b) to the consolidated financial statements, the Company\u2019s investment in an option to purchase equity securities of PharmaCann, Inc. (the \u201cPharmaCann Option\u201d) is accounted for as an other investment without a readily determinable fair value.To estimate the fair value of the PharmaCann Option, management uses a combination of the income and market approaches.Under the income approach, significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow method that require the use of judgment are the discount rate, terminal growth rate, cash flow projections, and the expectation of federal rescheduling and individual state legalization of cannabis in the United States.Under the market valuation approach, the key assumptions which require judgment under the Guideline Public Companies method are cash flow projections, selected multiples, and the discount for lack of marketability. As disclosed in note 14(a) of the consolidated financial statements, the Company\u2019s other investment in PharmaCann Option amounted to $25,650 thousand as of December 31, 2023.We identified the evaluation of the impairment assessment of PharmaCann Option as a critical audit matter.As the original cash flow projections of the investee were not prepared by management, a high degree of challenging auditor judgement was required to evaluate fair value of the investment.These assumptions were challenging to test as they represented subjective determinations of future market, economic, and legal conditions that are sensitive to variation.Minor changes to these assumptions could have had a significant73Table of Contentsimpact on the Company\u2019s assessment of the fair value of the PharmaCann Option.Additionally, the audit effort associated with this estimate required specialized skills and knowledge.The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of an internal control related to the critical audit matter.We compared the historical cash flow projections of PharmaCann to actual results to assess the Company\u2019s ability to accurately project PharmaCann cash flows.We evaluated the reasonableness of the cash flow projections by comparing them to historical actual results, planned business initiatives, external industry reports, and peer data.We evaluated the reasonableness of the expectation of federal rescheduling and individual state legalization of cannabis in the United States by comparing management\u2019s estimated timing with external industry reports and market information.In addition, we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:\u2022assessing the discount rate used in the income approach and the multiples used in the market approach against ranges that were independently developed using peer data,\u2022evaluating the terminal growth rate used in the income approach by comparing management\u2019s assumption against external market information, and;\u2022independently developing a discount for lack of marketability and comparing to management\u2019s assumption used in the market approach.Assessment of held for sale classification for the Cronos Fermentation facilityAs discussed in Note 1(s) of the consolidated financial statements, the Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets that it plans to dispose of through sale for held-for-sale classification. To be classified as held-for-sale, management must have committed to a plan to sell, the asset (or asset group) must be available for immediate sale in its present condition, an active program to locate a buyer must have been initiated, the sale must be probable to close within one year, the asset (or asset group) must be marketed at a reasonable sales price, and it must be unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made.Once an asset (or asset group) meets all the above criteria, it is reclassified as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet, and the assets cease depreciation and are written down to their fair value, less costs to sell, if applicable.As discussed in Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company has $59,468 thousand of property, plant and equipment, which includes the Fermentation facility located in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. The Company completed a review of its global supply chain and determined that it would wind-down the Fermentation facility and list it for sale.This review involves significant complexities and judgments in making the accounting treatment determination.There are subjective and complex judgments in the determination of whether the Fermentation facility meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, including: (1) whether the Fermentation facility is available for sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such businesses, (2) whether the sale of the Fermentation facility is probable and that the transfer of assets will be a completed sale within one year from period end, and (3) whether the Fermentation facility is being actively marketed at a reasonable price.We identified the assessment of held for sale classification for the Fermentation facility as a critical audit matter because of the degree of subjectivity associated with significant judgments made in determining whether events have occurred indicating that the Fermentation facility should be presented as held for sale. This required a high degree of auditor judgment when performing audit procedures to evaluate whether management appropriately classified the assets of the Fermentation facility.The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter.We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of an internal control related to the critical audit matter.We evaluated the Company\u2019s assessment of held for sale criteria as it relates to the Fermentation facility, which included:\u2022interviewing key members of management, their real estate agents and the Board of Directors to obtain an understanding of the plans to sell the Fermentation facility, including the marketing efforts and pricing strategy, and;\u2022reading minutes from meetings of the Board of Directors and reading communications regarding the status of the sales process./s/ KPMG LLPChartered Professional Accountants, Licensed Public AccountantsWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2018.Vaughan, CanadaFebruary 29, 202474Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Shareholders and Board of DirectorsCronos Group Inc.:Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingWe have audited Cronos Group Inc. and subsidiaries\u2019 (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on established in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of net loss and comprehensive loss, changes in shareholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023 and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 29, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.Basis for OpinionThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial ReportingA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate./s/ KPMG LLPChartered Professional Accountants, Licensed Public AccountantsVaughan, CanadaFebruary 29, 202475CRONOS GROUP INC.

Background, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies(a)BackgroundCronos Group Inc. (\u201cCronos\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) is incorporated in the province of British Columbia and under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) with principal executive offices at 111 Peter St., Suite 300, Toronto, Ontario, M5V 2H1.The Company\u2019s common shares are currently listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (\u201cTSX\u201d) and Nasdaq Global Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) under the ticker symbol \u201cCRON.\u201dCronos is an innovative global cannabinoid company committed to building disruptive intellectual property by advancing cannabis research, technology and product development.With a passion to responsibly elevate the consumer experience, Cronos is building an iconic brand portfolio.Cronos\u2019 diverse international brand portfolio includes Spinach\u00ae, PEACE NATURALS\u00ae and Lord Jones\u00ae. (b) Basis of presentationThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cU.S.GAAP\u201d).Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation of our consolidated financial statements, which includes discontinued operations.These reclassifications had no effect on reported results of operations and ending shareholders\u2019 equity.(c) Basis of consolidationThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, and all entities in which the Company has a controlling voting interest or is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest as of and for the reporting periods.The Company assesses control under the variable interest entity (\u201cVIE\u201d) model to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of that entity\u2019s operations. If an entity is not deemed to be a VIE, the Company consolidates the entity if the Company has a controlling voting interest.Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Company.They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.Investments in which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee, but does not have control, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.The Company consolidates the financial results of the following entities, which the Company controls but does not wholly own:##table 29##(i)These Israeli entities are collectively referred to as \u201cCronos Israel.\u201d(ii) \u201cOwnership interest\u201d is defined as the proportionate share of net income to which the Company is entitled; equity interest may differ from ownership interest as described herein.In the consolidated statements of net loss and comprehensive loss, net loss and comprehensive loss are attributed to the equity holders of the Company and to the non-controlling interests. Non-controlling interests in the equity of Cronos Israel are presented separately in the shareholders\u2019 equity section of the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of shareholders\u2019 equity.All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated upon consolidation.(d) Use of estimatesThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.Significant estimates and assumptions include, among other things, valuation of derivative liabilities, expected credit losses on long-term financial assets, impairment losses on goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, impairment losses on long-lived assets,81Cronos Group Inc.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except for share amounts)inventory write-downs, share-bared payments, valuation allowance on deferred income tax assets and uncertain tax liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.(e) Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investmentsCash and cash equivalents are comprised of cash and highly liquid short-term investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash, generally with original maturities of three months or less.Cash and cash equivalents include amounts held in dollars, C$, and ILS and security deposits.Short-term investments consist of debt securities that (i) generally have original maturities of greater than three months and (ii) the Company has the ability to convert into cash within one year.Short-term investments are classified as held-to-maturity and recorded at cost.Interest earned on short-term investments is recorded in other receivables on the consolidated balance sheets and interest income, net on the consolidated statements of net loss and comprehensive loss. Cash inflows and outflows related to the purchase and maturity of short-term investments are classified as investing activities in the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of cash flows.(f) InventoryInventory is comprised of raw materials, finished goods and work-in-progress, such as pre-harvested cannabis plants, dried flower, by-products to be extracted, cannabis extracts and by-products, dry cannabis and cannabis extract containers, and boxes.When the Company cultivated cannabis, costs capitalized into inventory until the time of harvest included, but were not limited to, labor, utilities, nutrition and irrigation.Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value, determined using weighted average cost.Cost includes expenditures directly related to manufacturing and distribution of the products. Primary costs include consumables (insect control, fertilizers, soil), packaging, shipping, direct labor, contract manufacturer fees, overhead, supplies and small tools, and the depreciation of manufacturing equipment and production facilities determined at normal capacity.Manufacturing overhead and related expenses include salaries, wages, employee benefits, rent, utilities, security, and property taxes.Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation.At the end of each reporting period, the Company performs an assessment to measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value.Factors considered in the determination of net realizable value include slow-moving or non-marketable products. (g)InvestmentsVariable interest entitiesA variable interest entity is an entity having either a total equity investment that is insufficient to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or equity investors at risk that lack the ability to control the entity\u2019s activities.Variable interests are investments or other interests that will absorb portions of a VIE\u2019s expected losses or receive portions of the VIE\u2019s expected residual returns.The Company evaluates whether it is the primary beneficiary of each VIE it identifies on a periodic basis and considers the impact of any reconsideration events.The primary beneficiary is the party that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE and holds a variable interest that could potentially be significant to the VIE. To make this determination, the Company considers both quantitative and qualitative factors regarding the nature, size and form of its involvement with the VIE.The Company consolidates a VIE when it is determined that it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE.Equity method investmentsThe Company accounts for investments in companies over which it has the ability to exercise significant influence but does not hold a controlling financial interest using the equity method.Under the equity method, the Company records its proportionate share of income or loss in share of income (loss) from equity method investments within the consolidated statements of net loss and comprehensive loss.Cash payments to equity method investees such as additional investments or expenses incurred on behalf of investees, as well as income earned and payments from equity method investees such as dividends and distributions are recorded as adjustments to investment balances. If the current fair value of an investment falls below its carrying amount, this may indicate that an impairment loss should be recorded.Any impairment losses recognized in one period cannot be reversed in subsequent periods.82Cronos Group Inc.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except for share amounts)Other investmentsOther investments include common stock and options in third-party entities in which the Company\u2019s influence is deemed non-significant.The Company holds other investments with and without readily determinable fair values.Other investments with readily determinable fair values are recorded using the fair value method of accounting as of period-end on the consolidated balance sheets.Other investments without readily determinable fair values are recorded using the cost method of accounting on the consolidated balance sheets. Other investments without readily determinable fair values are assessed for observable price changes and other than temporary impairment on a periodic basis.Changes in the reported value of other investments are reported in the consolidated statements of net loss and comprehensive loss.(h) Property, plant and equipmentProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:##table 30##When assets are disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and any related gain or loss is recognized.Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.Significant expenditures, which increase productivity or extend the useful life of the asset, are capitalized.Available for use is defined as the point at which the related property, plant and equipment is operational, including the possession of any requisite licenses. Depreciation commences at the point the assets are available for use.(i) Definite-lived intangible assetsIntangible assets are recorded at cost less any accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses.Intangible assets acquired through a business combination are measured at fair value at the acquisition date.The Company capitalizes certain costs incurred in connection with its enterprise software, which include external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal-use software and payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time to the development of the software for the function intended.All other costs are expensed as incurred.Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the following methods and rates:##table 31##(i) The preliminary licenses granted to Kibbutz Gan Shmuel (the Cronos Israel joint venture partner) by the Medical Cannabis Unit of the Israeli Ministry of Health in early 2017 (the \u201cIsraeli codes\u201d) were transferred by non-controlling interests to Cronos Israel in exchange for equity interests in the Cronos Israel entities specified above.Amortization begins when assets become available for use. The estimated useful life, amortization method, and rate are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.Intangible assets originating from the strategic partnership (the \u201cGinkgo Strategic Partnership\u201d) with Ginkgo Bioworks Holdings, Inc. (\u201cGinkgo\u201d) are accounted for in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting.Equity interests issued in exchange for an asset are initially recognized and measured at the date of acquisition at fair value.We estimate fair value using the relief-from-royalty method and key assumptions include the discount rate and estimated life.Definite-lived intangible assets, including intangible assets originating from the Ginkgo Strategic Partnership, are subject to amortization and reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that fair value has been reduced to less than its carrying amount.83Cronos Group Inc.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except for share amounts)(j)Accrued liabilitiesAccrued liabilities consist of the following:##table 32##Accrued payroll and related expenses include salaries and wages, bonuses, and other related payroll expenses associated with the Company\u2019s employees. Accrued professional fees include fees for legal expenses, litigation, consulting, marketing, and other related expenses.Accrued taxes include sales, excise and other taxes owed.Other accrued expenses include the fair value of deferred share units outstanding to directors and other general expenses.(k) LeasesThe Company enters into leases in the normal course of business, primarily for the land-use rights, office premises, and equipment used in the production of its products.At the inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease.A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.The Company performs an analysis over the classification of the lease agreement as either an operating lease or finance lease.A right-of-use asset and the related lease obligation associated with the lease are recorded at the inception of the lease. The right-of-use asset\u2019s recorded amount is based on the present value of future lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date plus any initial direct costs incurred.If the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable for the Company\u2019s operating leases, an incremental borrowing rate is generally used based on information available at the lease commencement date to determine the present value of future lease payments.Subsequent changes to these lease payments due to rate updates are recorded as lease expense in the period incurred.Leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet as a lease.The right-of-use asset is subject to impairment testing whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The leased asset is amortized over the shorter of the lease term or its estimated useful life if title does not transfer to the Company, while the leased asset is depreciated in accordance with the Company\u2019s depreciation policy if the title is to eventually transfer to the Company.The Company\u2019s lease agreements generally exclude non-lease components.As a result, non-lease components are accounted for separately for all classes of assets and expensed as incurred.In addition, the Company\u2019s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.For finance leases, from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term, the right-of-use asset is amortized on a straight-line basis and the interest expense is recognized on the lease liability using the effective interest method. For operating leases, lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and presented as a single charge in the consolidated statements of net loss and comprehensive loss.(l) Derivative liabilitiesFor financial instruments classified as derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments or do not qualify for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recorded in the consolidated statements of net loss and comprehensive loss each period.The Company does not enter into or hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.Derivative liabilities are initially recognized at fair value at the date on which the derivative contract was entered into.Any attributable transaction costs are recognized in net loss as incurred.Subsequent to initial recognition, derivative liabilities are measured at fair value at each reporting date until settlement with the re-measurement gain or loss being recognized immediately in net loss and comprehensive loss. For more details on derivative liabilities consisting of the Altria Warrant, Pre-emptive Rights, and certain Top-up Rights, see Note 9 \u201cDerivative Liabilities.\u201d(m) Capital stockCapital stock is presented at the fair value at the time of issuance of the shares issued.Costs related to the issuance of shares are reported in equity, net of tax, as a deduction from the issuance proceeds.84Cronos Group Inc.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except for share amounts)(n) Revenue recognitionRevenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer.The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer. The Company\u2019s contracts with customers for the sale of dried flower, cannabis oil, cannabinoid-derived products and \u201chemp\u201d (as defined in the U.S.Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 \u201cU.S.hemp\u201d) derived products consist of a single performance obligation.The Company has concluded that revenue from the sale of these products should be recognized at the point in time when control is transferred to the customer, depending on the specific contractual terms.The Company has determined that the most definitive demonstration that control has transferred to a customer is physical shipment or delivery, depending on the contractual shipping terms, except for consignment transactions.Consignment transactions are arrangements where the Company transfers product to a customer or third-party location but retains ownership and control of such product until it is used by the customer. Revenue for consignment arrangements is recognized upon the customer\u2019s usage.Revenue is recognized at the transaction price, which is the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods to a customer.Net revenue before excise taxes from sale of goods, as presented in the consolidated statements of net loss and comprehensive loss, represents revenue from the sale of goods less expected price discounts, allowances for customer returns and other forms of variable consideration.If the consideration in a contract includes a variable amount, the Company estimates the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the goods to the customer.The variable consideration is estimated using either the expected value or most likely amount method, based on the Company\u2019s historical information, at contract inception. The Company\u2019s payment terms vary by customer and product type.The Company treats shipping and handling activities as a fulfillment cost, classified as cost of sales.Accordingly, the Company accrues all fulfillment costs related to the shipping and handling of consumer goods at the time of shipment.The following table presents the Company's revenue by major product category for continuing operations:##table 33##Net revenue attributed to a geographic region based on the location of the customer was as follows:##table 34##(o) Research and developmentThe Company has a research and development center in Canada that performs scientific research on the interaction of cannabinoids as well as strain development, growing conditions and extraction technology.In 2023, fermentation and production related research was performed to further strategic initiatives around rare cannabinoids. In addition, the Company has a collaboration and license agreement with Ginkgo (the \u201cGinkgo Collaboration Agreement\u201d) to research, produce, and commercialize cultured cannabinoids.Technological feasibility is considered to be established once productivity targets or commercialization are achieved, at which point the exclusive license is recognized at cost less impairment charges.As of the acquisition date of each exclusive license, cost less impairment charges is equal to the fair value.Refer to Note 7 \u201cGoodwill and Intangible Assets, net\u201d for more information on the Ginkgo Collaboration Arrangement.Research and development costs associated with these collective efforts are expensed as incurred as part of operating expenses in the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of net loss and comprehensive loss.85Cronos Group Inc.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except for share amounts)(p) Advertising costsAdvertising costs include costs to sell the Company\u2019s products and are expensed as incurred through sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of net loss and comprehensive loss. Advertising costs were $ 1,382 , $ 889 and $ 2,229 for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.(q) Share-based compensationThe Company has five share-based compensation plans under which awards have been made: the 2020 Omnibus Plan, the 2018 Stock Option Plan, the 2015 Stock Option Plan, the Employment Inducement Award Plan and the DSU Plan (each as defined below).Share-based awards consists of equity-settled share-based awards such as stock options and restricted share units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) that are issued to eligible employees, non-executive directors, and non-employees.Cash-settled deferred share units (\u201cDSUs\u201d) that are issued to non-executive directors under the DSU Plan are recorded in accrued liabilities with the fair value adjustment recorded in other income.Equity instruments granted are initially measured at fair value on the grant date. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.The fair value of RSUs and DSUs are determined using the market price of the Company\u2019s common shares.Compensation expense related to options and RSUs is recognized on a straight-line basis in the consolidated statements of net loss and comprehensive loss over the vesting period for employees, and over the contractual term for non-employees.The fair value of the payout of cash-settled DSUs is determined at each reporting date based on the fair value of the Company\u2019s common shares at the reporting date and is recorded within other liabilities.The related costs for all equity-settled share-based awards are reflected in additional paid-in capital until the awards are settled or exercised.Upon settlement or exercise, shares are issued and the amount previously reflected in additional paid-in capital is, along with any proceeds paid upon settlement or exercise, credited to a combination of share capital and additional paid-in capital. Forfeitures of share-based compensation awards are accounted for as reductions to share-based compensation and additional paid-in capital as they occur.(r) Impairment of long-lived assetsThe Company reviews its long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment.In accordance with ASC Topic 360, long-lived assets to be held are reviewed for events or changes in circumstances that indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.The Company periodically reviews for indicators and, if indicators are present, tests the carrying amount of long-lived assets, assessing their recoverable value based on estimated undiscounted cash flows over their remaining estimated useful lives. The Company groups assets at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable, referred to as an asset group.If the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset group, based on discounted cash flows.(s) Assets held for sale and discontinued operationsIn accordance with ASC 205-20 Presentation of Financial Statements: Discontinued Operations, a disposal of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity is required to be reported as discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity\u2019s operations and financial results when the components of an entity meet the criteria in paragraph ASC 205-20-45-10. In the period in which the component meets held-for-sale or discontinued operations criteria, the major current assets, other assets, current liabilities, and other liabilities are reported as components of total assets and liabilities separate from those balances of the continuing operations.At the same time, the results of all discontinued operations, less applicable income taxes (benefit), are reported as components of net loss separate from the net loss of continuing operations.The Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets that it plans to dispose of through sale for held-for-sale classification.To be classified as held-for-sale, management must have committed to a plan to sell, the asset (or asset group) must be available for immediate sale in its present condition, an active program to locate a buyer must have been initiated, the sale must be probable to close within one year, the asset (or asset group) must be marketed at a reasonable sales price, and it must be unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made. Once an asset (or asset group) meets all of the above criteria, it is reclassified as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet, and the asset(s) cease depreciation and are written down to their fair value, less costs to sell, if applicable.The Company completed a review of its global supply chain and determined that it would wind down its Winnipeg, Manitoba facility (\u201cCronos Fermentation\u201d) and list it for sale.This review involves significant complexities and judgments in making the accounting treatment determination.There are subjective and complex judgments in the determination of whether the Cronos Fermentation facility meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, including: (1) whether the Cronos Fermentation facility is available for sale in its present condition subject only\u2002to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such businesses, (2) whether the sale of the86Cronos Group Inc.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except for share amounts)Cronos Fermentation facility is probable and that the transfer of assets will be a completed sale within one year from period end, and (3) whether the Cronos Fermentation facility is being actively marketed at a reasonable price. See Note 6 \u201cProperty, plant and equipment, net\u201d for discussion regarding our evaluation of the Peace Naturals Campus and the Cronos Fermentation facility for held-for-sale classification as of December 31, 2023.(t) Impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assetsGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized.Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that fair value of the reporting unit has been reduced to less than its carrying amount in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 350, Intangibles\u2014Goodwill and Other .The Company performs an impairment test annually in the fourth quarter by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered to be impaired.An impairment charge would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit\u2019s fair value.(u) Income taxesThe Company uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such assets and liabilities are recovered or settled.The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the year that includes the enactment date. The Company determines deferred tax assets including net operating losses and liabilities, based on temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities.A valuation allowance is established to reduce some or all net deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized.The Company considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.A valuation allowance against some or all of the net deferred tax assets does not in any way impact the Company\u2019s ability to use future tax deductions such as the Company\u2019s net operating loss carryforwards; rather, the valuation allowance indicates, according to the provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowance that was established will be maintained until there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized.The Company\u2019s income tax expense for future periods will be reduced to the extent of corresponding decreases in our valuation allowance.There is uncertainty regarding any future realization of the benefit by the Company of all or part of our net deferred tax assets.Judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes.The Company uses a two-step approach for evaluating uncertain tax positions.Step one, recognition, requires us to determine whether the weight of available evidence indicates that a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. If a tax position is not considered \u201cmore likely than not\u201d to be sustained, no benefits of the position are recognized.If we determine that a position is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d to be sustained, then we proceed to step two, measurement, which is based on the largest amount of benefit which is more likely than not to be realized on effective settlement.This process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure, including assessing the risks associated with income tax audits, together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes.If actual results differ from our estimates, our net operating loss and credit carryforwards, to the extent not covered by a valuation allowance, could be materially impacted in the period which such determination is made.The Company recognizes uncertain income tax positions at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained.Recognition or measurement is reflected in the period in which the likelihood changes.Any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax liabilities are presented within income tax expense in the consolidated statements of net loss and comprehensive loss.Accrued interest and penalties are included in accounts payable and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.87Cronos Group Inc.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except for share amounts)(v) Foreign currencyThe Company\u2019s functional currency is the Canadian dollar (\u201cC$\u201d) and its reporting currency is the U.S. dollar.Functional currencies for the entities in these consolidated financial statements are their respective local currencies, including C$, U.S. dollar and Israeli New Shekel (\u201cILS\u201d). All assets and liabilities of operations with a functional currency other than the Canadian dollar are translated into Canadian dollars at the period-end currency exchange rates and subsequently translated into U.S. dollars at period-end currency exchange rates.The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.Revenues and expenses of operations, as well as all cash flows, with a functional currency other than the Canadian dollar are translated into Canadian dollars at the average exchange rates for the period and subsequently translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates for the period.Transaction gains and losses resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates are recorded in either cost of sales, general and administrative expenses, or foreign currency transaction gain (loss) in the consolidated statements of net loss and comprehensive loss. (w) SegmentsSegment reporting is prepared on the same basis that the Company\u2019s chief operating decision maker (the \u201cCODM\u201d) manages the business, makes operating decisions and assesses the Company\u2019s performance.Historically, the Company has reported results for two reportable segments, the U.S. and Rest of World.In the second quarter of 2023, as a result of the Company\u2019s exit of its then-existing U.S. operations, the Company determined that it has one operating segment and therefore one reportable segment.All prior period segment disclosure information has been reclassified to conform to the current reporting structure in this Annual Report.These reclassifications had no effect on our consolidated financial statements in any period presented.(x) Earnings (loss) per shareThe Company presents basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share data for its common shares. Basic earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to common shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.Diluted earnings (loss) per share is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to common shareholders and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the effects of all potentially dilutive common shares.(y) Fair value measurementsThe carrying amount of the Company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other receivables, loans receivable, accounts payable and other liabilities approximate fair value, given their short-term nature.Cronos uses a fair value hierarchy, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, noted as Level 1 measurements, and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs, noted as Level 3 measurements.The following are the three levels of inputs used to measure fair value:\u2022Level 1 \u2013 valuation based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.\u2022Level 2 \u2013 valuation techniques based on inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.\u2022Level 3 \u2013 valuation techniques using the inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.The Company\u2019s policy for determining when transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy occur is based on the date of the event or changes in circumstances that caused the transfer. (z) Adoption of new accounting pronouncementsOn January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments \u2013 Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures (\u201cASU 2022-02\u201d).ASU 2022-02 eliminates the existing troubled debt restructuring recognition and measurement guidance, and instead aligns the accounting treatment to that of other loan modifications.The amendments enhance existing disclosure requirements and introduce new requirements related to certain modifications of receivables made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty.ASU 2022-02 also requires that entities disclose current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases.The adoption of ASU 2022-02 did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.88Cronos Group Inc.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except for share amounts)(aa)New accounting pronouncements not yet adoptedIn June 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued ASU 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions (\u201cASU 2022-03\u201d). ASU 2022-03 clarifies that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered in measuring fair value.The amendments also require additional disclosures for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions.ASU 2022-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years, and we expect to adopt ASU 2022-03 prospectively.The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2022-03 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (\u201cASU 2023-07\u201d).ASU 2023-07 enhances reportable segment disclosures by requiring disclosures such as significant segment expenses, information on the CODM and disclosures for entities with a single reportable segment. Additionally, the amendments enhance interim disclosure requirements, clarify circumstances in which an entity can disclose multiple segment measures of profit or loss, and contain other disclosure requirements.ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and we expect to adopt ASU 2023-07 retrospectively.The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2023-07 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (\u201cASU 2023-09\u201d).ASU 2023-09 enhances the existing income tax disclosures to provide additional information to better assess how an entity\u2019s operations, related tax risks and tax planning, and operational opportunities affect its tax rate and prospects for future cash flows. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and we expect to adopt ASU 2023-09 prospectively.The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2023-09 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.2.Discontinued OperationsIn the second quarter of 2023, the Company exited its then-existing U.S. hemp-derived cannabinoid product operations.The exit of the U.S. operations represented a strategic shift that has a major effect on the Company\u2019s operations and financial results, and as such,89Cronos Group Inc.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except for share amounts)qualifies for reporting as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of net loss and comprehensive loss. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to reflect the discontinued operations classification of the U.S. operations.The following table presents the major components comprising loss from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021:##table 35##(i)For the year ended December 31, 2023, Inventory write-down relates to the disposal of obsolete inventory as a result of the exit of the U.S.operations.(ii)During the year ended December 31, 2023, as a result of the exit of the U.S. operations, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $ 205 related to the right-of-use lease assets associated with the Company\u2019s former U.S. manufacturing facility in Los Angeles, California.For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company concluded that the carrying amount of the U.S. reporting unit exceeded its fair value, which resulted in the recognition of an impairment charge of $ 178,414 on goodwill and concluded the carrying amount of the Lord Jones\u00ae brand exceeded its fair value, which resulted in impairment charges of $ 57,500 on its Lord Jones\u00ae brand intangible asset.

As of December 31, 2023, the Company has no right-of-use assets or lease obligations associated with its U.S. discontinued operations.For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the aggregate depreciation expense on right-of-use assets associated with the Company\u2019s U.S. discontinued operations was $ 198 , $ 865 and $ 548 , respectively, and was included in loss from discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of net loss and comprehensive loss.##table 40##3.Inventory, netInventory, net is comprised of the following items:##table 41##4.Investments(a)Variable interest entities and investments in equity method investments, netThe Company holds variable interests in Cronos Growing Company Inc. (\u201cCronos GrowCo\u201d) and Cannasoul Lab Services Ltd. (\u201cCLS\u201d).The Company\u2019s investment in Cronos GrowCo is exposed to economic variability based on the entity\u2019s performance; however, the Company does not consolidate the entity as it does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity\u2019s economic performance. Thus, the Company is not considered the primary beneficiary of the entity.The investment in Cronos GrowCo is accounted for as an equity method investment classified as \u201cEquity method investments, net\u201d in the consolidated balance sheets.Cronos GrowCoCronos GrowCo is a joint venture incorporated under the Canada Business Corporations Act on June 14, 2018, with the objective of cultivating and commercializing cannabis and cannabis products.Cronos GrowCo\u2019s economic performance is driven by the day-to-day operations of Cronos GrowCo, which are controlled by 2645485 Ontario Inc. (\u201cMucci\u201d), the Company\u2019s joint venture partner.93Cronos Group Inc.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except for share amounts)During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company concluded that lower than expected sales forecasts combined with the increase to the aggregate principal amount of the GrowCo Credit Facility (as defined below) were indicators of impairment for the Company\u2019s equity method investment in Cronos GrowCo. Accordingly, the Company performed a quantitative impairment assessment in the third quarter of 2021 to compare the fair value of the investment in Cronos GrowCo to its carrying amount.The fair value was estimated using the discounted cash flow method.Significant inputs included discount rate, growth rates, and cash flow projections.As a result of this analysis, the Company concluded that as of September 30, 2021, the estimated fair value was higher than the carrying amount and no impairment charges were recorded.There were no such indicators of impairment present for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.CLSCLS is a wholly owned subsidiary of Cannasoul Analytics Ltd., incorporated with the purpose of establishing a commercial cannabis analytical testing laboratory located on the premises of Cronos Israel (the \u201cCannasoul Collaboration\u201d). Cronos Israel agreed to advance up to ILS 8,297 ($ 2,664 ) by a non-recourse loan (the \u201cCannasoul Collaboration Loan\u201d) to CLS over a period of two years from April 1, 2020 for the capital and operating expenditures of the laboratory.The loan bears interest at 3.5 % annually.Cronos Israel will receive 70 % of the profits of the laboratory until such time as it has recovered 150 % of the amounts advanced to CLS, after which time it will receive 50 % of the laboratory profits.As a result, the Company is exposed to economic variability from CLS\u2019s performance.The Company does not consolidate CLS as it does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity\u2019s economic performance; thus, the Company is not considered the primary beneficiary of the entity.The carrying amount of the non-recourse loan is recorded under loans receivable and the full loan amount, ILS 8,297 , represents the Company\u2019s maximum potential exposure to losses through the Cannasoul Collaboration. See Note 5 \u201cLoans Receivable, net\u201d for further information regarding loans receivable.A reconciliation of the carrying amount of the investments in equity method investments, net is as follows:##table 42##The following is a summary of the Company\u2019s share of net income (losses) from equity investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting:##table 43##(i)As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company held a 9.6 % and 9.9 % ownership interest, respectively, in Vitura, and Vitura was no longer considered an equity-method investment.As of and up to December 16, 2021, the Company held a 31 % ownership interest in Vitura and was considered an equity-method investment.(ii)As of December 31, 2021, the combination of the Company\u2019s share of accumulated net losses and impairment charges was in excess of its equity investment in Natuera, and the net book value of the investment was zero.The following is a summary of financial information for the Company\u2019s equity method investments:##table 44##94Cronos Group Inc.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except for share amounts)##table 45##The following is a summary of the maximum exposure to loss from the Company\u2019s investments in equity method investments:##table 46####table 47##The Company\u2019s maximum exposure to loss is equal to the carrying amount of the investment.

(\u201cPharmaCann\u201d), a vertically integrated cannabis company in the United States, at an exercise price of $ 0.0001 per share, representing approximately 10.5 % of PharmaCann\u2019s issued and outstanding capital stock on a fully diluted basis as of the date of the PharmaCann Option, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $ 110,392 .The option exercise will be based upon various factors, including the status of U.S. federal cannabis legalization, as well as regulatory approvals, including in the states where PharmaCann operates that may be required upon exercise. The Company has deemed its influence in PharmaCann to be non-significant.The PharmaCann Option is classified as an investment in an equity security without a readily determinable fair value.The Company measures the PharmaCann Option at cost less accumulated impairment charges, if any, and subsequently adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.The PharmaCann Option is reported as Other investments on the consolidated balance sheet for the periods ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.As of December 31, 2021, the Company performed an assessment on the existence of impairment indicators on the PharmaCann Option and noted no indicators of impairment existed.As such, no impairment loss on the investment was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2021.On February 28, 2022, PharmaCann closed its previously announced transaction with LivWell Holdings, Inc. (\u201cLivWell\u201d) pursuant to which PharmaCann acquired LivWell (the \u201cLivWell Transaction\u201d). As a result of the LivWell Transaction, the Company\u2019s ownership percentage in PharmaCann on a fully diluted basis decreased to approximately 6.4 %.As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company\u2019s ownership percentage in PharmaCann on a fully diluted basis was approximately 5.9 % and 6.3 %, respectively.Under the terms of the Company\u2019s investment in PharmaCann, the Company\u2019s rights to nominate an observer or a director to the PharmaCann board of directors could be lost if the Company\u2019s ownership drops below 6 % on a fully diluted basis and it sells or transfer all or any portion of the option (subject to certain exceptions).The decrease in the Company\u2019s ownership percentage since acquisition does not materially affect the Company\u2019s rights under the PharmaCann Option.During the first, third and fourth quarters of 2022, the Company identified adverse forecast changes in the financial performance of PharmaCann as indicators of impairment related to the PharmaCann Option and conducted analyses comparing the PharmaCann Option\u2019s carrying amount to its estimated fair value. The fair value was estimated using a combination of the income approach and the market approach.Under the income approach, significant inputs used in the discounted cash flow method include discount rate, growth rates, cash flow projections, and the expectation of federal rescheduling and individual state legalization of cannabis in the U.S.Under the market valuation approach, the key assumptions are the selected multiples and the discount for lack of marketability.As a result of these analyses, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $ 11,238 , $ 28,972 and $ 21,182 in the first, third and fourth quarters of 2022, respectively, as the difference between the carrying amount of the PharmaCann Option and its estimated fair value, in the consolidated statements of net loss and comprehensive loss.95Cronos Group Inc.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except for share amounts)During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company identified adverse forecast changes in the financial performance of PharmaCann as an indicator of impairment related to the PharmaCann Option and conducted an analysis comparing the PharmaCann Option\u2019s carrying amount to its estimated fair value.

The Cronos Australia Merger closed on December 16, 2021.In connection with the closing of the Cronos Australia Merger, all advances made under the Company\u2019s A$ 1,500 unsecured loan to Cronos Australia, plus accrued interest and certain royalties payable, were converted into ordinary shares of Cronos Australia.In addition, the Company\u2019s ownership interest in Cronos Australia decreased to approximately 10 % and the Company\u2019s number of Cronos Australia board seats was reduced from two to zero .On November 29, 2022, the shareholders of Cronos Australia approved the proposal to change the name of the company to \u201cVitura Health Limited\u201d (the \u201cCAU Name Change\u201d).On December 2, 2022, in connection with the CAU Name Change, Vitura and the Company mutually agreed to terminate the intellectual property license that granted Vitura the right to use certain intellectual property of the Company, including, but not limited to, the \u201cCronos\u201d name and the PEACE NATURALS\u00ae brand. The reduction in ownership interest and loss of all board seats constituted a loss of significant influence and resulted in a reclassification on the consolidated balance sheet from investments in equity method investments using the equity method of accounting to other investments using the fair value method of accounting, with unrealized holding gains and losses included in net loss on the consolidated statements of net loss and comprehensive loss.The Company recorded a loss on revaluation of other investments of $ 12,096 for the year ended December 31, 2023, and a gain on revaluation of other investments of $ 14,739 for the year ended December 31, 2022, included in the gain on revaluation of financial instruments on the statements of net loss and comprehensive loss.The Company\u2019s investment in Vitura was $ 9,601 and $ 21,993 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and is included in other investments on the consolidated balance sheets.The following table summarizes the Company\u2019s other investments activity:##table 48####table 49##96Cronos Group Inc.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except for share amounts)5.

The determination to seek a sublease of the property and include leasehold improvements and other office equipment in any potential sublease agreement triggered the impairment charges.The impairment charge was recognized as impairment loss on long-lived assets on the consolidated statements of net loss and comprehensive loss.During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company concluded that indicators of impairment were present with respect to its Canadian asset group in connection with the previously anticipated wind-down and closure of the Company\u2019s facility in Stayner, Ontario.As a result, the Company compared the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the Canadian asset group to their respective carrying amounts and recorded a non-cash impairment charge on long-lived assets of $ 113,917 as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset group and its estimated fair value for the year ended December 31, 2021, in the consolidated statements of net loss and comprehensive loss.Held-for-sale AssessmentsThe Company evaluated both the Peace Naturals Campus and the Cronos Fermentation facility for held-for-sale classification as of December 31, 2023, and, as a result of the assessments, determined that neither asset group met the criteria to be classified as held-for-sale as of December 31, 2023. The Peace Naturals Campus failed the criteria, as the facility is not immediately available for sale in its present condition due to ongoing construction related to the condition the facility must be in for the proposed leaseback to occur.The Cronos Fermentation facility failed the criteria as it was determined it was not probable to sell the property within one year, and the property was not being marketed at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value, as the property is currently being marketed unpriced.98Cronos Group Inc.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except for share amounts)7.Goodwill and Intangible Assets, net(a)GoodwillGoodwill is comprised of the following items:##table 54####table 55##(b)Intangible assets, netIntangible assets, net are comprised of the following items:##table 56####table 57##(i) The Israeli codes were transferred by non-controlling interests to Cronos Israel in exchange for their equity interests in the Cronos Israel entities.99Cronos Group Inc.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except for share amounts)Ginkgo Exclusive LicensesCBGAIn August 2021, the Company achieved the final productivity target in respect of cannabigerolic acid (\u201cCBGA\u201d), under the Ginkgo Collaboration Agreement.

These rights may not be exercised if Altria\u2019s ownership percentage of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company falls below 20 %.b.In addition to (and without duplication of) the Pre-emptive Rights, the Company granted to Altria, subject to certain qualifications and limitations, the right to subscribe for common shares of the Company issuable in connection with the exercise, conversion or exchange of convertible securities of the Company issued prior to March 8, 2019 or thereafter (excluding any convertible securities of the Company owned by Altria or any of its subsidiaries), a share incentive plan of the Company, the exercise of any right granted by the Company pro rata to all shareholders of the Company to purchase additional common shares and/or securities of the Company, bona fide bank debt, equipment financing or non-equity interim financing transactions that contemplate an equity component or bona fide acquisitions (including acquisitions of assets or rights under a license or otherwise), mergers or similar business combination transactions or joint ventures involving the Company in order to maintain their ownership percentage of issued and outstanding common shares of the Company immediately preceding any such transactions (\u201cTop-up Rights\u201d).The price per common share to be paid by Altria pursuant to the exercise of its Top-up Rights will be, subject to certain limited exceptions, the 10 -day volume-weighted average price of the common shares of the Company on the TSX for the 10 full days preceding such exercise by Altria; provided that the price per common share of the Company to be paid by Altria pursuant to the exercise of its Top-up Rights in connection with the issuance of common shares of the Company pursuant to the exercise of options or warrants that were outstanding as of March 8, 2019 will be C$ 16.25 per common share without any set off, counterclaim, deduction, or withholding. These rights may not be exercised if Altria\u2019s ownership percentage of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company falls below 20 %.The Altria Warrant, Pre-emptive Rights, and fixed price Top-up Rights have been classified as derivative liabilities on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet.103Cronos Group Inc.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except for share amounts)As of December 31, 2023, Altria beneficially held 156,573,537 of the Company\u2019s common shares, an approximate 41.1 % ownership interest in the Company (calculated on a non-diluted basis).Reconciliations of the carrying amounts of the derivative liability are presented below:##table 64####table 65##Fluctuations in the expected life of the derivative instruments and the Company\u2019s share price are primary drivers for the changes in the derivative valuations during each reporting period. As the period of time the derivative liability is expected to be outstanding decreases and the share price decreases, the fair value typically decreases for each related derivative instrument.Weighted-average expected life and share price are two of the significant observable inputs used in the fair value measurement of each of the Company\u2019s derivative instruments.The fair values of the derivative liabilities were determined using the Black-Scholes pricing model using the following inputs:##table 66####table 67##(i) The risk-free interest rate was based on Bank of Canada government treasury bills and bonds with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the derivative liabilities.As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the risk-free interest rate uses a range of approximately 3.99 % to 4.82 % and 3.81 % to 4.37 %, respectively, for the Pre-emptive Rights and Top-up Rights. (ii) The expected life represents the period of time, in years, that the derivative liabilities are expected to be outstanding.The expected life of the Pre-emptive Rights and Top-up Rights is determined based on the expected term of the underlying options, warrants, and shares, to which the Pre-emptive Rights and Top-up Rights are linked.As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the expected life uses a range of approximately 0.50 years to 1.75 years and 0.25 years to 2.75 years, respectively.(iii) Volatility was based on an equally weighted blended historical and implied volatility level of the underlying equity securities of the Company.104Cronos Group Inc.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except for share amounts)10.

The Services Agreement will remain in effect until terminated by either party.See Note 15 \u201cRelated Party Transactions.\u201d(b)ContingenciesThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of its business and in connection with its marketing, distribution and sale of its products.Many of these legal proceedings are in the early stages of litigation and seek damages that are unspecified or not quantified.Although the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not believe these legal proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition but could be material to its results of operations for any particular reporting period depending, in part, on its results for that period. (i)Class action complaints relating to restatement of 2019 interim financial statementsOn March 11 and 12, 2020, two alleged shareholders of the Company separately filed two putative class action complaints in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York against the Company and its Chief Executive Officer and former Chief Financial Officer.The court consolidated the cases, and the consolidated amended complaint alleges violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) and Rule 10b-5, promulgated thereunder, against all defendants, and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the individual defendants.The consolidated amended complaint generally alleges that certain of the Company\u2019s prior public statements about revenues and internal controls were incorrect based on the Company\u2019s disclosures relating to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors\u2019 review of the appropriateness of revenue recognized in connection with certain bulk resin purchases and sales of products through the wholesale channel. The consolidated amended complaint does not quantify a damage request.The defendants moved to dismiss on February 8, 2021.On November 17, 2023, the court entered an order granting the motion and dismissed the case with prejudice.On December 1, 2023, the shareholder plaintiffs sought reconsideration of the dismissal, requesting that the court instead dismiss the action without prejudice and permit the plaintiffs to seek leave to further amend the complaint.The reconsideration motion is pending.105Cronos Group Inc.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except for share amounts)On June 3, 2020, an alleged shareholder filed a Statement of Claim, as amended on August 12, 2020, in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, seeking, among other things, an order certifying the action as a class action on behalf of a putative class of shareholders and damages of an unspecified amount. The Amended Statement of Claim named (i) the Company, (ii) its Chief Executive Officer, (iii) former Chief Financial Officer, (iv) former Chief Financial Officer and Chief Commercial Officer, and (v) current and former members of the Board as defendants and alleged breaches of the Ontario Securities Act, oppression under the Ontario Business Corporations Act and common law misrepresentation.The Amended Statement of Claim generally alleged that certain of the Company\u2019s prior public statements about revenues and internal controls were misrepresentations based on the Company\u2019s March 2, 2020 disclosure that the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors was conducting a review of the appropriateness of revenue recognized in connection with certain bulk resin purchases and sales of products through the wholesale channel, and the Company\u2019s subsequent restatement. The Amended Statement of Claim did not quantify a damage request.On June 28, 2021, the Court dismissed motions brought by the plaintiff for leave to commence a claim for misrepresentation under the Ontario Securities Act and for certification of the action as a class action.The plaintiff appealed the Court\u2019s dismissal of the motions only with respect to the Company, the Chief Executive Officer, and the now former Chief Financial Officer; the remaining defendants were dismissed from the matter with prejudice and the Company and all individual defendants agreed not to seek costs from plaintiff in connection with the dismissal of the motions.On September 26, 2022, the Court of Appeal for Ontario reversed the Superior Court\u2019s dismissal of the leave and certification motions, granted the plaintiff leave to proceed to bring a claim for misrepresentation under the Ontario Securities Act, and remitted the certification motion back to the Superior Court. On April 11, 2023, the plaintiff filed a Fresh as Amended Statement of Claim, which reflected the dismissal of the defendants for which an appeal was not sought, the removal of the claims for oppression under the Ontario Business Corporations Act and common law misrepresentation, as well as shortening the proposed class period.On October 10, 2023, the Superior Court certified the action on behalf of a class of persons or entities who acquired shares in the secondary market, including on the TSX and Nasdaq, during the period from May 9, 2019 to March 30, 2020, other than certain excluded persons.(ii)Regulatory SettlementsOn October 24, 2022, the Company announced regulatory settlements as follows:SEC SettlementOn October 24, 2022, the SEC issued an Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 8(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d) and Section 21(c) of the Exchange Act, Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order (the \u201cSettlement Order\u201d) resolving the Restatements.The Company agreed to settle with the SEC, without admitting or denying the allegations described in the Settlement Order.

Share-based Compensation(a)Share-based award plansThe Company has granted stock options, RSUs and DSUs to employees and non-employee directors under the Stock Option Plan dated May 26, 2015 (the \u201c2015 Stock Option Plan\u201d), the 2018 Stock Option Plan dated June 28, 2018 (the \u201c2018 Stock Option Plan\u201d and, together with the 2015 Stock Option Plan, the \u201cPrior Option Plans\u201d), the Employment Inducement Award Plan #1 (the \u201cEmployment Inducement Award Plan\u201d), the 2020 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan dated March 29, 2020 (the \u201c2020 Omnibus Plan\u201d) and the DSU plan dated August 10, 2019 (the \u201cDSU Plan\u201d).The Company can no longer make grants under the Prior Option Plans or the Employment Inducement Award Plan.The following table summarizes the total share-based compensation associated with the Company\u2019s stock options and RSUs:##table 68##(i)Represents share-based compensation awards conditionally approved for grant to one of the Company\u2019s former executives for a fixed monetary value, but a variable number of shares. These awards were liability-classified until the number of shares was determined.(b)Stock optionsThe Company adopted the 2015 Stock Option Plan, which was approved by shareholders of the Company at the annual general meeting of shareholders held on June 28, 2017.The 2015 Stock Option Plan allowed the Board to award options to purchase shares to directors, officers, key employees and service providers of the Company.As of June 28, 2018, no further awards will be granted under the 2015 Stock Option Plan; as of December 31, 2023, no options issued under the 2015 Stock Option Plan remain outstanding.On June 28, 2018, the shareholders of the Company approved the 2018 Stock Option Plan, which replaced the 2015 Stock Option Plan.The 2018 Stock Option Plan terminated the Company\u2019s ability to grant equity under the 2015 Stock Option Plan. As of June 25, 2020, the date on which the 2020 Omnibus Plan was approved by the shareholders of the Company, no further awards will be granted under the 2018 Stock Option Plan; however, shares may be purchased via option exercise by the holders of any outstanding options previously issued under the 2018 Stock Option Plan.On March 29, 2020, the Board adopted the 2020 Omnibus Plan, which was approved by the shareholders of the Company at the annual and special meeting of shareholders held on June 25, 2020.The 2020 Omnibus Plan provides for grants of stock options, share appreciation rights, restricted shares, RSUs and other share-based or cash-based awards, which are subject to terms as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board (the \u201cCompensation Committee\u201d), and awards may be granted to eligible employees, non-employee directors and consultants. The 2020 Omnibus Plan terminated the Company\u2019s ability to grant equity awards under the 2018 Stock Option Plan and RSUs under the Employment Inducement Award Plan.107Cronos Group Inc.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except for share amounts)Options represent the right to purchase Company common shares on the date of exercise at a stated exercise price.The exercise price of an option generally must be at least equal to the fair market value of the Company common shares on the date of grant.Vesting conditions for grants of options are determined by the Compensation Committee.The typical vesting for stock option grants is quarterly vesting over three to five years .The maximum term of options granted under the 2020 Omnibus Plan is seven years . Participants under the 2020 Omnibus Plan are eligible to be granted options to purchase shares at an exercise price established upon approval of the grant by the Compensation Committee.When options are granted, the exercise price is, with respect to a particular date, the closing price as reported by the TSX or the Nasdaq and, if the shares are not traded on the TSX or the Nasdaq, any other stock exchange on which the Company\u2019s common shares are traded (as selected by the Compensation Committee in good faith taking into account applicable legal and tax requirements) on the immediately preceding trading day (the \u201cFair Market Value\u201d).The 2020 Omnibus Plan does not authorize grants of options with an exercise price below the Fair Market Value.The following is a summary of the changes in options:##table 69####table 70##(i)The weighted average exercise price reflects the conversion of foreign currency-denominated stock options translated into C$ using the average foreign exchange rate as of the date of issuance.For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the fair value per option at grant date was C$ 2.07 and C$ 2.94 , respectively. The fair value of the options issued during the year was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, using the following inputs:##table 71##(i) The expected life of the awards represents the period of time options are expected to be outstanding and is estimated considering vesting terms and employees\u2019 and non-employees\u2019 historical exercise and, where relevant, post-vesting employment termination behavior.Volatility was estimated by using the historical volatility of the Company\u2019s share price, adjusted for the Company\u2019s expectation of volatility going forward.The risk-free interest rate was based on the Bank of Canada government bonds with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options at the grant date.108Cronos Group Inc.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except for share amounts)The following table summarizes stock options outstanding:##table 72##(c)Restricted share unitsRSUs are granted under the 2020 Omnibus Plan. RSUs represent an equivalent amount of Company common shares on the date of issuance at fair value.Fair value is determined using the closing price of the trading day immediately preceding the date of grant.RSUs issued under the 2020 Omnibus Plan typically vest over a three-year period following the grant date and have no performance requirements.The following is a summary of the changes in RSUs:##table 73####table 74##(i)RSUs granted in the period vest annually in equal installments over a three-year period from either the grant date or after a three or five year \u201ccliff-period.\u201d All RSUs are subject to such holder\u2019s continued employment through each vesting date.The vesting of such RSUs is not subject to the achievement of any performance criteria.(ii)Equity grants for 2020, 2021 and 2022 were held back for certain executives of the Company in connection with ongoing investigations by the SEC and the OSC, which were subsequently settled on October 24, 2022. On August 5, 2022, the Compensation Committee approved the release of these held-back equity grants conditioned upon settlement of the SEC and OSC investigations.These RSUs vest in equal installments over a period of three years from what would have been their original grant dates had the grants not been withheld.(iii)The weighted-average grant date fair value reflects the conversion of foreign currency-denominated RSUs translated into C$ using the foreign exchange rate as of the date of issuance.109Cronos Group Inc.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except for share amounts)(d)Deferred share unitsOn August 10, 2019, the Company established the DSU Plan pursuant to which its non-executive directors receive DSUs for Board services. The DSU Plan is designed to promote a greater alignment of long-term interests between non-executive directors and shareholders.The number of DSUs granted under the DSU Plan (including fractional DSUs) is determined by dividing the amount of remuneration payable by the closing price as reported by the TSX for awards made prior to 2022 and as reported by Nasdaq for awards made in 2022 and 2023 on the trading day immediately preceding the date of grant.DSUs are payable at the time a non-executive director ceases to hold the office of director for any reason and are settled by a lump-sum cash payment, in accordance with the terms of the DSU Plan, based on the fair value of the DSUs at such time.The fair value of the cash payout is determined by multiplying the number of DSUs vested at the payout date by the closing price as reported by the TSX for awards made prior to 2022 and as reported by Nasdaq for awards made in 2022 and 2023 on the trading day immediately preceding the payout date. The fair value of the cash payout is determined at each reporting date based on the fair value of the Company\u2019s common shares at the reporting date and is recorded within other liabilities.The following is a summary of the changes in DSUs:##table 75####table 76##(e)Liability-classified awardsDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Compensation Committee conditionally approved the grant to one of the Company\u2019s former executives of share-based compensation awards for a fixed monetary amount, but a variable number of common shares.These awards were liability-classified until the number of common shares was determined.##table 77##During the year ended December 31, 2023, there was no liability-classified award activity.12.Income TaxesFor financial reporting purposes, loss from continuing operations before income taxes includes the following components:##table 78##The loss before income taxes above excludes losses from discontinued operations of $ 4,114 , $ 13,556 and $ 269,125 for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.110Cronos Group Inc.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except for share amounts)Income tax expense (benefit) consists of the following components:##table 79##As of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company\u2019s current income taxes payable were $ 64 , $ 32,956 and $ 105 , respectively, related to current income tax expense. Included in other receivables as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 is $ 3,374 , $ 40 and $ 543 , respectively, related to current income tax benefits.Income tax differs from that computed using the combined Canadian federal and provincial statutory income tax rate of 26.5%.Reconciliation of the expected income tax to the effective tax rate in continuing operations is as follows:##table 80##The valuation allowance recorded against the loss on discontinued operations is not reflected in the effective tax rate reconciliation presented above for continuing operations.For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company realized a capital gain for tax purposes of $ 479,800 as a result of Altria\u2019s irrevocable relinquishment of its warrant on December 16, 2022, resulting in an increase in the total income tax expense reported for the year ended December 31, 2022.111Cronos Group Inc.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except for share amounts)The following table summarizes the significant components of the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets and liabilities:##table 81##(i)Net deferred tax asset (liability) is reported as Other assets within our consolidated balance sheet.The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the Company\u2019s generating sufficient taxable income in the years that the temporary differences become deductible. A valuation allowance has been provided for the deferred tax assets that the Company determined did not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold under U.S. GAAP.As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company\u2019s valuation allowance was $ 216,241 and $ 214,199 , respectively.The valuation allowance increased by $ 2,042 during the year ended December 31, 2023, and decreased by $ 10,577 during the year ended December 31, 2022.The increase in the valuation allowance during the year ended December 31, 2023, was primarily due to an increase in net operating loss carryforwards.The decrease in the valuation allowance during the year ended December 31, 2022, was primarily due to the recognition of a portion of deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance was recorded in the prior year.As of December 31, 2023, the Company had net operating losses in Canada, the U.S., and Israel available to offset future years\u2019 taxable income of approximately $ 253,521 , $ 144,219 , $ 20,794 , respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had net operating losses in Canada, the U.S., and Israel available to offset future years\u2019 taxable income of approximately $ 216,120 , $ 134,593 , and $ 18,739 , respectively.The net operating losses in Canada will begin to expire, for purposes of carryforward, in fiscal year 2033.The net operating losses in the U.S. can be carried forward indefinitely for federal purposes.The net operating losses in Israel can be carried forward indefinitely.Utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to limitations under the tax laws applicable in each tax jurisdiction due to ownership changes that could occur in the future.These ownership changes could limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets that can be utilized to offset future taxable income and tax expense. Due to the existence of the valuation allowance, limitations created by ownership changes, if any, will not impact the Company\u2019s effective tax rate.As of December 31, 2023, the Company has various scientific research and experimental development investment tax credit carryforwards of $ 683 related to Canadian operations, which, if not utilized, will begin to expire in 2041.Investment tax credits are recognized when realization of the tax credits is more likely than not.The Company files federal income tax returns in Canada, Israel and the U.S.The Company has open tax years with the taxation jurisdictions.These open years contain certain matters that could be subject to differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and112Cronos Group Inc.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except for share amounts)regulations and tax treaties, as they relate to the amount, timing, or inclusion of revenue and expense. As of December 31, 2023, Peace Naturals and Hortican Inc. are under examination with the Canadian Revenue Agency for tax years 2019 and 2020.##table 82##Accounting guidance clarifies the accounting for uncertain tax positions and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.Additionally, the authoritative guidance addresses the derecognition, classification, accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions.Only tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold may be recognized.There were no identified unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2023 or December 31, 2022.As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, deferred income taxes have not been provided for any undistributed earnings from operations outside of Canada. The foreign subsidiaries have accumulated losses and as such the amount of undistributed earnings upon which income taxes have not been provided is immaterial to these consolidated financial statements.13.Loss per ShareBasic and diluted earnings (loss) per share from continued and discontinued operations are calculated as follows:##table 83##(i)In computing diluted earnings per share, incremental common shares are not considered in periods in which a net loss is reported, as the inclusion of the common share equivalents would be anti-dilutive.Total securities of 25,426,119 , 112,612,579 and 125,195,001 were not included in the computation of diluted shares outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, because the effect would be anti-dilutive.113Cronos Group Inc.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except for share amounts)14. Financial Instruments(a)Fair value measurementThe Company complies with ASC 820 Fair Value Measurements for its financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at each reporting period and non-financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at least annually.In general, fair values are determined by:\u2022Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\u2022Level 2 inputs utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves.\u2022Level 3 inputs are unobservable data points for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability.114Cronos Group Inc.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except for share amounts)The following tables present information about the Company\u2019s assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques the Company utilized to determine such fair value:##table 84####table 85##(i)As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company\u2019s influence on Vitura is deemed non-significant and the investment is considered an equity security with a readily determinable fair value. See Note 4 \u201cInvestments\u201d for additional information.There were no transfers between fair value categories during the periods presented.The following tables present information about the Company\u2019s assets that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques the Company utilized to determine such fair value:##table 86####table 87##(i)On June 14, 2021, the Company purchased an option to acquire 473,787 shares of Class A Common Stock of PharmaCann, a vertically integrated cannabis company in the United States, at an exercise price of $ 0.0001 per share, representing approximately 10.5 % of PharmaCann\u2019s issued and outstanding capital stock on a fully diluted basis as of the date of the PharmaCann Option, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $ 110,392 . On February 28, 2022, PharmaCann closed its previously announced transaction with LivWell pursuant to which PharmaCann acquired LivWell.As a result of the LivWell Transaction, the Company\u2019s ownership percentage in PharmaCann on a fully diluted basis decreased to approximately 6.4 %.As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company\u2019s ownership percentage in PharmaCann on a fully diluted basis was approximately 5.9 % and 6.3 %, respectively.See Note 4 \u201cInvestments\u201d.There were no transfers between fair value categories during the periods presented.(b)Financial risksThe Company\u2019s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk, interest rate risk, and foreign currency rate risk.Credit riskCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities, primarily accounts receivable and other receivables, and its investing activities, including cash held with banks and financial institutions, short term investments, loans receivable, and advances to joint ventures.The Company\u2019s maximum exposure to this risk is equal to the carrying amount of these financial assets, which amounted to $ 966,442 and $ 987,836 as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.115Cronos Group Inc.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except for share amounts)(i)Accounts receivableThe Company had accounts receivable of $ 13,984 and $ 23,113 as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date using a provision matrix to measure expected credit losses.The provision rates are based on the days past due for groupings of various customer segments with similar loss patterns.The calculation reflects the probability-weighted outcome, the time value of money and reasonable and supportable information that is available at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.Accounts receivable are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.Indicators that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include, amongst others, the failure of a debtor to engage in a repayment plan, and a failure to make contractual payments for a period of greater than 120 days past due. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had $ 3 and $ 219 , respectively, in expected credit losses on receivables from contracts with customers.As of December 31, 2023, the Company has assessed that there is a concentration of credit risk as 37 % of the Company\u2019s accounts receivable were due from one customer with an established credit history with the Company.As of December 31, 2022, 55 % of the Company\u2019s accounts receivable were due from three customers with an established credit history with the Company.The Company sells products through a limited number of major customers.Major customers are defined as customers that each individually accounted for greater than 10% of the Company\u2019s revenues.During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company earned a total net revenue before excise taxes of $ 79,503 from three major customers, together accounting for 66 % of the Company\u2019s total net revenue before excise taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company earned a total net revenue before excise taxes of $ 63,509 from three major customers, together accounting for 55 % of the Company\u2019s total net revenue before excise taxes.During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company earned a total net revenue before excise taxes of $ 41,603 from three major customers, accounting for 56 % of the Company\u2019s total net revenues before excise taxes.(ii) Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and other receivablesThe Company held cash and cash equivalents of $ 669,291 and $ 764,644 as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.The short-term investments and related interest receivable of $ 192,237 and $ 113,077 as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, represent short-term investments with a maturity of less than a year and accrued interest. The cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, including guaranteed investment certificates and bankers\u2019 acceptances, are held with central banks and financial institutions that are highly rated.In addition to interest receivable, other receivables include sales taxes receivable from the government.As such, the Company has assessed an insignificant loss allowance on these financial instruments.Liquidity riskLiquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they become due and arises principally from the Company\u2019s accounts payable.The Company had trade accounts payable of $ 8,887 and $ 8,599 as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheet.The Company\u2019s policy is to review liquidity resources and ensure that sufficient funds are available to meet financial obligations as they become due. Further, the Company\u2019s management is responsible for ensuring funds exist and are readily accessible to support business opportunities as they arise.As of December 31, 2023, the Company has assessed a concentration of risk of vendors as 26 % of accounts payable were due to one vendor.As of December 31, 2022, the Company has assessed a concentration risk of vendors as 27 % of accounts payable due to one vendor.Market riskMarket risk is the risk that the fair value of, or future cash flows from, the Company\u2019s financial instruments will significantly fluctuate due to changes in market prices.The value of financial instruments can be affected by changes in interest rates, market and economic conditions, and equity and commodity prices.The Company is exposed to market risk in divesting its investments, such that unfavorable market conditions could result in dispositions of investments at less than their carrying amounts. Further, the revaluation of securities classified as fair value through net income could result in significant write-downs of the Company\u2019s investments, which would have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations, unless these would flow through other comprehensive income.The Company manages risk by having a portfolio of securities from multiple issuers, such that the Company was not materially exposed to any one issuer.116Cronos Group Inc.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except for share amounts)Interest rate riskInterest rate risk is the risk that the value or yield of fixed-income investments may decline if interest rates change.Fluctuations in interest rates may impact the level of income and expense recorded on the cash equivalents and short-term investments, and the market value of all interest-earning assets, other than those that possess a short term to maturity. A 10% change in the interest rate in effect on December 31, 2023 would not have a material effect on the fair value of our cash equivalents and short-term investments as the majority of the portfolio had a maturity date of three months or less.A 10% change in the interest rate in effect for 2023 would have an effect of $ 5.4 million on interest income, net earned on our cash equivalents and short-term investments.A 10% change in the interest rate in effect on December 31, 2022, would not have a material effect on (i) fair value of the cash equivalents and short-term investments as the majority of the portfolio had a maturity date of three months or less, or (ii) interest income, net.Management continues to monitor external interest rates and revise the Company\u2019s investment strategy as a result.During the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had net interest income of $ 51,235 and $ 22,514 , respectively.
