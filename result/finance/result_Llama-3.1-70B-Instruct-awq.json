irreversible morbidity or mortality (IMM) and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.\n\nDrugs and biological products granted Accelerated Approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.\n\nFor the purposes of Accelerated Approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit.\n\nAn intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug or biological product, such as an effect on IMM.\n\nThe Accelerated Approval Pathway is contingent on a sponsor\u2019s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product\u2019s clinical benefit.\n\nAs a result, a drug or biological product candidate approved on this basis

current year (Table 68)\n* A $363 million increase in storm revenues at Duke Energy Florida due to hurricanes Ian and Nicole collections (Table 68)\n* A $276 million increase due to higher pricing at Duke Energy Progress from the South Carolina rate case and interim rates from the North Carolina rate case (Table 68)\n* A $115 million increase in rider revenues primarily due to a decrease in the return of EDIT to customers compared to the prior year at Duke Energy Carolinas and increased Storm Protection Plan rider revenue at Duke Energy Florida (Table 68)\n* A $67 million increase due to the provision for rate refund recognized in the prior year related to the Indiana Supreme Court ruling on recovery of certain coal ash costs (Table 68)\n\nHowever, these increases were partially offset by:\n\n* A $341 million decrease in retail sales due to unfavorable weather compared to prior year (Table 68)\n* A $323 million decrease in wholesale revenues primarily due to lower demand at Duke Energy Florida and lower prices at Duke Energy Indiana (Table 68)\n* A $173 million decrease in weather-normal retail sales volumes (Table 68)\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can see that the primary

Delays in clinical trials can lead to a loss of patent protection, which can be a significant disadvantage for companies. The patent life of a product candidate is typically 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. If a product candidate is delayed in clinical trials, the patent life may expire before the product candidate is approved for marketing. This can lead to a loss of exclusivity and allow generic competition, which can be a significant threat to the commercial success of the product candidate.\n\nAdditionally, delays in clinical trials can also impact the ability of companies to obtain regulatory approval. The FDA and other regulatory authorities require extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a product candidate. If a product candidate is delayed in clinical trials, the company may not be able to complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials to support regulatory approval. This can lead to a delay in obtaining regulatory approval, which can have a significant impact on the commercial success of the product candidate.\n\nFurthermore, delays in clinical trials can also impact the ability of companies to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or other regulatory authorities that the product candidate is safe and effective as a treatment for the targeted indications. Clinical trials are a critical component of the regulatory approval process, and delays in clinical trials can make it more difficult for companies to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of their product candidates.\n\nIn summary, delays in clinical trials can have a significant impact on the commercial success of product candidates, including the potential loss of patent protection, the ability to obtain regulatory approval, and the ability to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product candidate."], "LLM_extracted_answer": ["B"], "ground_truth": "B"}, {"depth": 40, "token_lengths": 128000, "result": 0.0, "question": "What action does the Company take to manage commodity price risk for its merchant generation operations?", "options": {"A": "Invests in renewable energy sources", "B": "Diversifies its energy portfolio", "C": "Enters into derivative instruments", "D": "Reduces energy consumption", "E": "Increases energy purchases", "F": "Halts energy operations"}, "LLM_original_answer": ["The company's business is focused on providing risk management products and services to the insurance, reinsurance, and other risk marketplaces.

The discussion is in the \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" section, under the \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" subsection. The relevant text is:\n\n\"Allowance for Credit Losses. The allowance for credit losses, or ACL, is established to provide for management\u2019s estimate of expected lifetime credit losses on loans measured at amortized cost and unfunded lending commitments at the balance sheet date and is established through a provision for credit losses charged to net income. Credit losses are charged directly to the ACL. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the ACL. Commercial and residential loans are charged-off in the period in which they are deemed uncollectible. Delinquent loans in these product types are subject to ongoing review and analysis to determine if a charge-off in the current period is appropriate. For consumer loans, policies and procedures exist that require charge-off consideration upon a certain triggering event depending on the product type. The ACL is evaluated on a regular basis by management. Management uses a methodology to systematically estimate the amount of expected lifetime losses in the portfolio. Expected lifetime losses are estimated on a collective basis for loans sharing similar risk characteristics and are determined using a quantitative model combined with an assessment of certain qualitative factors designed to address forecast risk and model risk inherent in the quantitative model output. For commercial and industrial, commercial real estate, commercial construction and business banking portfolios, the quantitative model uses a loan rating system which is comprised of management\u2019s determination of a financial asset\u2019s probability of default, loss given default, and exposure at default, which are derived from historical loss experience and other factors. For residential real estate, consumer home equity and other consumer portfolios, our quantitative model uses historical loss experience. The quantitative model estimates expected credit losses using loan level data over the estimated life of the exposure, considering the effect of prepayments. Economic forecasts are incorporated into the estimate over a reasonable and supportable forecast period of eight quarters, beyond which is a reversion to our historical loss average which occurs over a period of four quarters. For loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with any pools of assets, expected credit losses are estimated individually using a discounted cash flow or fair value of collateral approach. Accrued interest receivable amounts are excluded from balances of loans held at amortized cost and are included within other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The section also mentions that adverse economic conditions could amplify other risk factors discussed in the section, including the company's competitive position and margins.\n\nBased on this information, I can conclude that unfavorable economic conditions could have a negative impact on the organization's financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe correct answer is: C) Reduce affordability and demand for products.\n\nThis answer is supported by the information in the \"Risk Factors\" section, which discusses the potential impact of unfavorable economic conditions on the company's business."], "LLM_extracted_answer": ["C"], "ground_truth": "C"}, {"depth": 85, "token_lengths": 64000, "result": 1.0, "question": "What is a potential consequence of changes in tax legislation and regulations on the company?", "options": {"A": "Increase in the number of employees", "B": "Decrease in production costs", "C": "Reduction in market share", "D": "Increase in the complexity and cost of tax compliance", "E": "Rise in customer satisfaction", "F": "Improved international partnerships"}, "LLM_original_answer": ["To answer the question, we need to find the relevant section in the document that discusses the potential consequences of changes in tax legislation and regulations on the company.\n\nAfter reviewing the document, I found the relevant section in \"Item 7.

However, the relevant information is actually located in the section \"3. Collaboration Agreements\" under the subheading \"Gilead\" and then in the section \"10. Income Taxes\".\n\nAccording to the document, changes in tax legislation and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Specifically, the document mentions that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 requires the company to capitalize and amortize research and experimental expenditures over five or fifteen years, which had a materially negative impact on the company's cash tax liability in 2023.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD: Increase in the complexity and cost of tax compliance.\n\nThis answer is supported by the document, which highlights the potential consequences of changes in tax legislation and regulations on the company's business and financial condition."], "LLM_extracted_answer": ["D"], "ground_truth": "D"}, {"depth": 85, "token_lengths": 64000, "result": 1.0, "question": "In the HOPD setting, how are additional procedures paid when performed during the same operative session with a higher valued code?", "options": {"A": "Each procedure is paid individually based on its value", "B": "All procedures are paid at a reduced flat rate", "C": "The highest valued code is paid at 100%, and additional procedures are bundled", "D": "Only cataract procedures are paid separately", "E": "The total payment is calculated based on the average of all procedure values", "F": "Procedures with lower valued codes are paid first, followed by the highest valued code"}, "LLM_original_answer": ["To answer the question, we need to analyze the provided document and identify the relevant information.\n\nThe question asks: \"In the HOPD setting, how are additional procedures paid when performed during the same operative session with a higher valued code?\"\n\nThe relevant information is found in the section \"Reimbursement for Uses of the OMNI Surgical System and SION Surgical Instrument\" under the subheading \"HOPD Setting\".\n\nAccording to the text, \"In the HOPD setting, Medicare procedures performed using OMNI and SION as well as cataract procedures, are paid under comprehensive ambulatory payment classifications (C-APCs).

However, the question specifically asks about the risks related to the retention of key members of the executive management team.\n\nUpon reviewing the document, I found that the relevant section is \"Risks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\" (Section 5). This section discusses the risks associated with the company's reliance on third-party manufacturers, suppliers, and contractors. However, it does not directly address the risk of losing key members of the executive management team.\n\nThe relevant section that addresses the risk of losing key personnel is actually \"Risks Related to Our Business Operations, Employee Matters and Managing Growth\" (Section 6). Specifically, the subsection \"We depend heavily on our executive officers, principal consultants and others, and the loss of their services would materially harm our business\" (Section 6.1) discusses the risk of losing key members of the executive management team.\n\nAccording to this section, the loss of key personnel could impede the achievement of the company's research, development, and commercialization objectives. The company's success depends on its ability to hire and retain the services of its current executive officers, principal consultants, and others.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD: A delay in the business plan and growth strategies.\n\nThis answer is supported by the document, which states that the loss of key personnel could impede the achievement of the company's research, development, and commercialization objectives, leading to a delay in the business plan and growth strategies."], "LLM_extracted_answer": ["D"], "ground_truth": "D"}, {"depth": 85, "token_lengths": 64000, "result": 1.0, "question": "What action may the STA take if they determine an indirect transfer of Chinese interests lacks a reasonable commercial purpose?", "options": {"A": "Cancel the transfer entirely", "B": "Impose a penalty on the transferee", "C": "Treat it as a direct transfer of Chinese interests", "D": "Reduce the applicable tax rate", "E": "Exempt the transfer from taxes", "F": "Require a local business licence"}, "LLM_original_answer": ["To answer the question, we need to analyze the document and identify the relevant information.\n\nThe question asks: \"What action may the STA take if they determine an indirect transfer of Chinese interests lacks a reasonable commercial purpose?\"\n\nThe relevant information is found in the section \"Gains on Indirect Disposal of Equity Interests in Our China Subsidiaries\" under the heading \"Regulations Relating to Taxation\".\n\nAccording to the document, if the STA determines that an indirect transfer of Chinese interests lacks a reasonable commercial purpose, they may treat such indirect transfer as a direct transfer of Chinese interests. This means that gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to Chinese enterprise income tax, and the transferee or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer would be obligated to withhold the applicable taxes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC: Treat it as a direct transfer of Chinese interests.\n\nThis answer is supported by the text: \"Using general anti-tax avoidance provisions, the STA may treat such indirect transfer as a direct transfer of Chinese interests if the transfer avoids Chinese tax by way of an arrangement without reasonable commercial purpose.\""], "LLM_extracted_answer": ["C"], "ground_truth": "C"}, {"depth": 85, "token_lengths": 64000, "result": 1.0, "question": "What specific technology do they rely on from third parties to authorize and verify credit card transactions?", "options": {"A": "Real-time credit card authorization", "B": "Biometric authentication", "C": "Blockchain encryption", "D": "Virtual private networks", "E": "Firewall protection", "F": "Antivirus software"}, "LLM_original_answer": ["To answer the question, we need to find the specific technology that Brighthouse Financial relies on from third parties to authorize and verify credit card transactions.\n\nAfter reviewing the document, I found the relevant information in the section \"9.
