The Court had to understand and apply the meaning of \"capacity\" in this context, as it is central to the Agreed Issues in the case. The Court considered the Combined-Panels Method and the Combined-Inverters Method for measuring capacity, as well as the \"footprint\" of the development and the \"footprint\" of solar panels. The Court also considered the blue and green areas of the development site, as shown in the Developer's drawings.

However, he found that factors i) and ii) in the Factortame checklist had been made out in the appellant's favour. However, he found that that was not on its own determinative or decisive.
