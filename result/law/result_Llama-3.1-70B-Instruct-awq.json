CNHs?\n\nThe answer is: The CNH would be terminated upon early termination of the corresponding FRTBL.\n\nThe reasoning is as follows:\n\n* The purpose of the CNHs was to transfer interest rate risk from CB to NAB.\n* The CNHs precisely matched the terms of the corresponding FRTBL, including the notional amount, fixed interest rate, and dates of repayment.\n* The CNHs were recorded on NAB's trade booking systems, and collateral was posted on a daily basis between NAB and CB.\n* The reconciliation file was used to identify and facilitate correction of any exceptions or errors in the recording of the CNHs.\n* The ISDA Master Agreement, originally executed in December 1997 between CB and NAB, covered all derivative trades, including the CNHs.\n* The Master Agreement provided for the parties to enter into a Confirmation as soon as practicable after each transaction.\n* Although the Confirmations were suppressed, the failure to do so does not detract from the conclusion that the CNHs were intended to constitute transactions within the umbrella of the Master Agreement.\n* The amendment to the Master Agreement in 2014 recognized the CNHs as intended to be contractually binding.\n* The Morph Transaction, pursuant to which NAB and CB released each other from \"any and all liability or obligations\" arising in respect of \"the NAB Swaps\", defined as including the CNHs.\n* The fact that NAB was CB's ultimate holding company did not entitle it simply to walk away from the CNHs.\n* The CNHs would have been terminated upon early termination of the corresponding FRTBL, as this would crystallize a loss for NAB, and thus a liability for CB.\n* The only way to avoid this continuing interest rate risk would be to terminate the CNH.\n* The fact that the CNHs did not give rise to legally binding obligations is not a reason to conclude that they would not be terminated upon early termination of the corresponding FRTBL.\n* The Banks' construction does not mean that an Affiliate can be a \"third party\", as it contemplates an agreement between CB and a party other than it (which may include an Affiliate) or an agreement between an Affiliate and a party other than it.\n* The CNHs were not hedging arrangements made in the external market, but this does not preclude them from qualifying as Hedging Arrangements"], "LLM_extracted_answer": ["B"], "ground_truth": "B"},

The relevant section states: \"Dr Hugh Series DM, FRCPsych, LLM, MA, MB, BS has practised as a consultant in the psychiatry of old age since 1995.

However, the court found that the Banks' words and conduct did not give rise to the implied representations.\n\nThe court considered the context in which the representations were made, including the terms of the facility letter and the strategy letter. The court found that the facility letter defined the interest rate payable under a FRTBL as the aggregate of the applicable \"(a) Margin; (b) Fixed Rate; and (c) Mandatory Costs.\" The strategy letter contrasted the \"rate you pay\" (i.e., the Fixed Rate) with a \"market rate\" (LIBOR).

The Claimant, Mr Galloway, lives in Burnhope and has concerns about the development's impact on the local landscape and footpaths. The Developer, a special purpose company related to Lightsource bp, applied for planning permission in June 2022, and the Council granted it in July 2023. The planning permission was for a solar farm with a capacity of up to 13,861 homes, connected to the National Grid by underground cable.\n\nThe Claimant's main issue is the interpretation of the planning condition 4, which requires the development to be carried out in \"strict accordance\" with the approved plans. The Claimant argues that this condition means that the development must be built exactly as shown in the approved plans, without any divergence. The Council and the Developer argue that the condition allows for some flexibility and that the development can be built with some minor variations.\n\nThe Claimant also raises concerns about the size of the solar farm and the number of panels required to achieve the desired capacity. The Claimant calculates that the solar farm would require 110,640 panels, each with a maximum power output of 685W, to achieve a capacity of 75.78MW. The Claimant argues that this is above the Statutory Capacity Threshold of 50MW and that the Council should have considered this when granting planning permission.\n\nThe Claimant also raises concerns about the blue and green areas of the development site, arguing that the Council should have considered the impact of the development on the local landscape and footpaths. The Claimant argues that the development would have a significant impact on the local area and that the Council should have taken this into account when granting planning permission.\n\nThe Claimant's second line of challenge is that the Council failed to consider whether the grant of planning permission was \"approving more panels over a larger area than were required\" for a 50MW solar farm. The Claimant argues that this was a material consideration that the Council should have taken into account when granting planning permission.\n\nThe Claimant also raises concerns about the NMA decision, which was made after the planning permission was granted. The Claimant argues that the NMA decision was flawed and that it should be quashed.\n\nThe Council and the Developer argue that the planning permission was granted in accordance with the relevant planning policies and that the development would have a positive impact on the local area.

The first three claimants are parties to one action, while the fourth claimant, Ivor Gaston & Son, is a partnership which carried on cattle and pig farming activities in Scotland and has brought a second action that has been tried together with the first action.\n\nThe claims all relate to a product marketed and sold by CB between about 1999 and 2012, called a \"Tailored Business Loan\" (TBL). TBLs took various forms, including variable rate loans, fixed rate loans, and a variety of more complex structures involving collars, caps, and floors. This case is concerned with only one of them, a fixed rate TBL (FRTBL), where the loan was made for a set period at a fixed rate of interest throughout that period.\n\nThe FRTBLs were not regulated products, and CB's staff did not have the requisite expertise to manage the interest rate risk inherent in FRTBLs. NAB's employees were closely involved in marketing and selling TBLs to CB's customers, and representatives of NAB's Treasury Solutions department worked alongside CB's relationship managers to provide quotes for the purpose of pricing FRTBLs.\n\nThe process was a joint one involving the customer's relationship manager at CB and representatives of NAB's Treasury Solutions department. CB did not at the time have the capability to manage the interest rate risk inherent in FRTBLs, so it transferred the risk via the CNHs to NAB. The CNHs were back-to-back hedging transactions between CB and NAB, which exactly mirrored the terms of the relevant FRTBL in terms of (notional) amount, interest rate, and repayment terms.\n\nThe claimants initially contended that CB was not entitled to charge break costs in the way that it did because there were no CNHs or that the CNHs did not create any legally binding obligations.

The process of marketing and selling FRTBLs was a joint one involving the customer's relationship manager at CB and representatives of NAB's Treasury Solutions department.\n\nThe claimants contend that CB was not entitled to charge break costs in the way that it did. They initially contended that CB was not entitled to charge break costs by reference to the amount it paid under the corresponding NAB hedge (CNH), but they now accept that there were CNHs. However, they contend that the CNHs did not create any legally binding obligation on CB to pay a sum to NAB in the event of the termination of the corresponding FRTBL.\n\nThe claimants also contend that CB was not entitled to charge break costs to the customer as it did. They rely on the Break Costs Explanation, which states that CB may incur costs which it calls \"break costs\" when a FRTBL is repaid early. However, the Break Costs Explanation does not define what break costs are or how they are calculated.\n\nThe Banks' case is that the principal operative part of clause 8.2 of the facility letter obliges the borrower to pay to CB an amount equal to \"any loss, cost or liability\" which CB determines that it or any of its Affiliates suffers or incurs as a result of, among other things, the early repayment of a FRTBL. The Banks point to the width of that wording and the fact that what follows is expressed to be by way of inclusion only and \"without limitation\".\n\nThe claimants contend that the Banks' construction of clause 8.2 is too broad and that it would allow CB to claim for losses that are not actually incurred. They argue that CB must have suffered an actual, crystallized loss or cost as a result of action taken by it in the external market following early repayment.\n\nThe Banks respond that the claimants' argument confuses two different issues: the question of whether loss has been suffered and the question as to the timing of the assessment of that loss.

The court must also consider whether the testator was suffering from a disorder of the mind that poisoned his affections, perverted his sense of right, or prevented the exercise of his natural faculties.\n\nThe claimants argue that Jack's instructions to Ms Wells were inconsistent and contained errors, and that Ms Wells did not take steps to assess Jack's capacity.

This argument would, in many cases, mean that the effect of the breach automatically overrode any other factor.\n\nThe judge's Francovich assessment is from [33]-[86]. In essence, the appellant's argument before the judge was the same as the argument now pursued on appeal, namely that the individual breach altered the outcome of the competition (because, but for the breach, the appellant would have been awarded the contract). The appellant therefore argued that this automatically meant that the breach was sufficiently serious to warrant an award of damages.\n\nThe judge considered and rejected that argument in two places in his Francovich Judgment. First at [44] he said: \"The fact that the breach may have altered the outcome of the competition does not automatically mean that it is sufficiently serious to warrant an award of damages.\" The judge then went on to consider and reject the appellant's argument that the breach was sufficiently serious to warrant an award of damages.\n\nThe judge's Francovich assessment is a detailed and thoughtful exercise. He considered various factors relevant to the assessment of whether or not the breach was sufficiently serious to justify an award of damages. The judge concluded his Francovich assessment in the following terms: \"In my judgment, the breach was not sufficiently serious to warrant an award of damages.\"\n\nThe judge's conclusion that the breach was not sufficiently serious to warrant an award of damages is a key issue in this appeal.

The court also found that the sum due from CB to NAB upon termination of a CNH was a reasonable proxy for that loss.\n\nThe court also found that the claimants' fixed rate claims failed because the Fixed Rate itself comprised two elements, (1) a rate that broadly reflected the mid-market swap rate for the size and tenor of the loan on the date of execution of the agreement and (2) additional basis points (up to 50) which represented additional income to CB, referred to internally by the Banks as \"Added Value\" (\"AV\").

The claimants point, among other things, to the fact that there is scope for disagreement over aspects of the way in which loss \u2013 on the Banks' case \u2013 is to be calculated: is the appropriate comparison between the interest payable at the fixed rate under the contract and at a floating rate, or at a fixed rate that might be achieved if the sum is re-lent to another customer?

He also correctly referred to his understanding that Margaret would receive his entire pension in excess of \u00a3100,000 per annum, but noted that owing to Eurotherm having been taken over by a German firm \"there may be changes in store\", which I infer indicates a concern that Margaret may not be able to rely on his pension, at least in full.

He said that he and Margaret agreed with the remainder of the letter, including the annuity for Andrew (which was to be taken into hotchpot), save that \"we don't understand paragraph 4\".

The 2015 will is different from the 2007 will, which was signed by Jack, in that it leaves a substantial portion of Jack's estate to Margaret and her family.\n\nThe court is considering the evidence of various witnesses, including Jack's children, Margaret's family, and experts in old age psychiatry.

The evidence in support consists of a line in Robert Gittins' statement: \"If we had understood that the fixed rates were not just the day's market rate, we would have preferred to have stuck with variable rate loans with known margins of between 1.25% and 1.5% (as we had previously).\" However, this statement is not supported by other evidence, and Janhill had previously entered into fixed rate loans with Cheshire Building Society in 1997 and had 40% of its borrowing with CB fixed by 2005. David Gittins, the key decision maker for Janhill, was described as \"risk averse\" and actively looking to borrow at fixed rates. The TBL documentation relevant to the Janhill FRTBLs entered into from 2005 onwards is the same as that relevant to Farol's FRTBL. The facility letter defines the interest rate payable under a FRTBL as the aggregate of the \"(a) Margin; (b) Fixed Rate; and (c) Mandatory Costs.\" The distinction between Margin and Fixed Rate is repeated on numerous occasions in communications by the Banks to Janhill. However, the TBL documentation does not provide any evidence that the Banks implied that the Fixed Rate was a market rate or that it did not include any additional income for the Banks. The reasonable customer in Janhill's position would have understood that the Fixed Rate was something other than a market rate, and that it was not a pure market rate without any element of income or profit for the Banks. The evidence does not support Janhill's claim that it relied on the Fixed Rate Representations in entering into its FRTBLs.\n\nThe claimants' lending expert, Mr Penman, agreed that commercial landlords will generally prefer lending at fixed rates, for the same reasons as Mr Sutton gave. However, the evidence does not support Janhill's claim that it would have entered into variable rate loans if it had known about the AV. The evidence shows that Janhill had long had both fixed rate and floating rate loans with CB, and the same Margin applied to all of the loans. Janhill does not suggest that anything in the Margin agreed between it and CB was to take account of the additional income for the Banks in relation to the fixed rate lending, yet Janhill had long had both fixed rate and floating rate loans with CB and the same Margin applied to all of the loans"], "LLM_extracted_answer": ["A"], "ground_truth": "C"}, {"depth": 50, "token_lengths": 96000, "result": 0.0, "question": "Who failed to provide Jack with his requested simple will?", "options": {"A": "Mr Mutsuddi", "B": "Barclays advisers", "C": "Jack himself", "D": "Mr Smith", "E": "Ms Wells", "F": "Ms Bultitude"}, "LLM_original_answer": ["The question is: Who failed to provide Jack with his requested simple will?

The termination amount payable under the CNH is a reasonable proxy for CB's loss arising as a result of early repayment even if it had not entered into any hedging agreement.\n\nThe claimants' claims also fail because the calculation of CB's loss involves comparing the NPV of fixed and floating interest rates for the remainder of the term of the FRTBL, and the law has developed well-established techniques for valuing the present loss of a contractual right consisting of a future income stream.\n\nThe claimants' claims are also subject to the limitation period under the Limitation Act 1980, which provides that a claim in deceit or negligence must be brought within 6 years of the date of the breach.

The Combined-Panels Method is not a \"legal litmus test\" for identifying the capacity of a solar farm, and there is no statutory definition or case law supporting it as the sole legally-correct \"interpretation\" of capacity.\n\nThe Harwood Argument also relies on the assumption that the Combined-Panels Method is the objectively correct interpretation of \"capacity\" in the Statutory Capacity Threshold. However, the position is that there are two recognized methods of measurement, the Combined-Panels Method and the Combined-Inverters Method, each of which has an important Accompanying Proviso.\n\nThe Harwood Argument is also based on the assumption that the Planning Permission authorizes the development of a solar farm with a capacity of 75.78MW. However, this calculation is based on the assumption that the Trina 685 Wp solar panels are incorporated as part of Approved Plan PNL-6839.

This is consistent with the principle of valuation, which typically involves considering the information that was available to the parties at the time of the valuation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB: Information that would/could have been known at the Valuation Dates\n\nThis answer is supported by the document, which indicates that the judge is considering information that was available at the time of the valuation, rather than information that became available later."], "LLM_extracted_answer": ["B"], "ground_truth": "B"}, {"depth": 60, "token_lengths": 32000, "result": 1.0, "question": "What reason was given to request an adjournment for the final hearing listed for March 2023?", "options": {"A": "The wife's interest in the family business", "B": "The post nuptial agreement", "C": "The husband's litigation misconduct", "D": "The Part III proceedings", "E": "The husband's asserted ill health", "F": "Outstanding orders for costs against the husband"}, "LLM_original_answer": ["The reason given to request an adjournment for the final hearing listed for March 2023 was the husband's asserted ill health."], "LLM_extracted_answer": ["E"], "ground_truth": "E"}, {"depth": 60, "token_lengths": 64000, "result": 1.0, "question": "On what date was the outline terms and conditions document, which included the 'fixed/hedged' rates, sent by Mr. Martin to Uglow?", "options": {"A": "20 November 2009", "B": "25 November 2009", "C": "5 December 2009", "D": "11 December 2009", "E": "15 December 2009", "F": "20 December 2009"}, "LLM_original_answer": ["The outline terms and conditions document, which included the 'fixed/hedged' rates, was sent by Mr. Martin to Uglow on or about 11 December 2009."], "LLM_extracted_answer": ["D"], "ground_truth": "D"}, {"depth": 60, "token_lengths": 64000, "result": 1.0, "question": "What did CB's standard documentation encourage customers to do before entering into a TBL?", "options": {"A": "Directly consult with CB's financial officers", "B": "Enter into the agreement with no consultations", "C": "Consult their own financial advisors", "D": "Rely solely on the Break Costs Explanation", "E": "Review multiple interest rates identified", "F": "Obtain a legal review from their attorney"}, "LLM_original_answer": ["The question is: What did CB's standard documentation encourage customers to do before entering into a TBL?\n\nThe answer is: Consult their own financial advisors."], "LLM_extracted_answer": ["C"], "ground_truth": "C"}, {"depth": 60, "token_lengths": 64000, "result": 1.0, "question": "What is one of the basic features of an appropriate offer as set out by Lord Hoffmann?", "options": {"A": "The offer must be made only by a government authority", "B": "It should provide immediate financial gain for the minority shareholders", "C": "The value should be determined by a competent expert if not agreed", "D": "The offer should include a provision for future investments", "E": "It must ensure legal representation by multiple experts", "F": "The offer needs to be withheld during financial audits"}, "LLM_original_answer": ["The question is about the basic features of an appropriate offer as set out by Lord Hoffmann.

The loans were marketed and sold by CB as a product called a \"Tailored Business Loan\" (TBL), which required a level of know-how and expertise on the part of the bank selling them. CB did not have the requisite expertise, and NAB's employees were closely involved in marketing and selling TBLs to CB's customers.\n\nThe process was a joint one involving the customer's relationship manager at CB and representatives of NAB's \"Treasury Solutions\" department. CB did not have the capability to manage the interest rate risk inherent in fixed rate loans, so it transferred the entirety of that risk to NAB. NAB then managed the risk assumed under the TBLs as part of the management of interest rate risk across its business on a macro- or portfolio-wide basis.\n\nThe claimants' claims fall into two parts: the break costs claims and the fixed rate claims. The break costs claims relate to the amounts charged by CB to the claimants as break costs when they repaid their loans early. The fixed rate claims relate to the fixed element in the rate of interest charged under the TBLs.\n\nThe claimants initially contended that CB was not entitled to charge break costs by reference to the amount it paid under the corresponding NAB hedge (CNH). However, they now accept that there were CNHs, but contend that they did not create any legally binding obligations on CB. Alternatively, they contend that even if CB was under an obligation to pay NAB under a CNH, it was not entitled to charge that sum to the customer as break costs.\n\nThe claimants also contend that they paid the break costs under the mistaken belief that CB was entitled to charge them.

over cost of funds\" for the new money and \"1 and a quarter\" for the existing debt. Robert Gittins, a director of Janhill, accepted the statement and said \"yes, we are.\" However, the statement was not an expression of any of the pleaded representations, and it could only amount to a representation that the Fixed Rate was a market rate and contained no income for CB if substantially more was implied into it.\n\nJonathan Palmer's statement was made in the context of a telephone call, and it is necessary to consider all the circumstances that would have been known to a reasonable person in Janhill's position. The documentation in relation to the first two Janhill FRTBLs differed from that used in respect of the other FRTBLs for these four claimants. The numerous references to \"cost of funds\" or \"cost of funding\" in this documentation unambiguously referred to the cost to Janhill of the funding from CB.\n\nA reasonable person in Janhill's position, with knowledge of these documents, would in my view have understood Mr. Palmer to be using the phrase \"cost of funds\" consistently with the way it was used in those documents. It is true that, in some cases, the interest rate set out in those documents and referred to as the cost of funds appears to have been the all-in rate (including Margin). In other cases, however, for example, the strategy letter of 18 December 2001, it is expressly identified as exclusive of Margin.\n\nThe contention that Mr. Palmer's statement would have been understood as identifying the Fixed Rate as a pure market rate is also inconsistent with the variety of rates being offered for the different products set out in the strategy letters. Even though the different rates offered were all-in rates, it is not suggested that the variations were due to different amounts of Margin, so the reasonable person in Janhill's position would have understood that CB was offering a different fixed element of the all-in rate for the different products.\n\nAccordingly, I reject Janhill's case that Mr. Palmer's statements in the telephone call on 4 October 2002 would have been understood by a reasonable person in Janhill's position as representing that the Fixed Rate of 5.29% was either a market rate or the cost to CB of obtaining funding.\n\n"], "LLM_extracted_answer": ["B"], "ground_truth": "D"}, {"depth": 65, "token_lengths": 128000, "result": 1.0, "question": "Which document mentioned Mr Horne's reference to the rate as 'Cost of Funds' plus a Margin?", "options": {"A": "The strategy paper provided to Farol on 22 January 2007", "B": "An email Mr Horne sent on 23 January 2007", "C": "The subject line of Mr Horne's email on 26 January 2007", "D": "A phone conversation between Mr Horne and Mr Jones", "E": "A written statement from Mr Jones'", "F": "A meeting note from the bank's internal discussions"}, "LLM_original_answer": ["The document does not mention Mr Horne's reference to the \"Cost of Funds\" in his email dated 23 January 2007."], "LLM_extracted_answer": ["B"], "ground_truth": "B"}, {"depth": 65, "token_lengths": 128000, "result": 0.0, "question": "What was one of the reasons mentioned for declining the opportunity with Lidl?", "options": {"A": "Inability to agree on terms", "B": "Lack of interest from Lidl", "C": "Concerns over product quality", "D": "Inability to handle 8 million units per annum", "E": "Financial instability", "F": "Shortage of skilled workers"}, "LLM_original_answer": ["The case involves four small or medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that entered into fixed interest rate loans with Clydesdale Bank PLC (CB) between 2002 and 2010. The loans were part of a product called a \"Tailored Business Loan\" (TBL), which was not regulated and required a level of expertise on the part of the bank selling them. CB's staff did not have the requisite expertise, whereas National Australia Bank Limited (NAB), CB's parent company, did. As a result, NAB's employees were closely involved in marketing and selling TBLs to CB's customers.\n\nThe process of entering into a TBL involved a joint effort between CB's relationship manager and NAB's Treasury Solutions department. The Treasury Solutions staff had access to market data, which enabled them to provide quotes for pricing FRTBLs. CB did not have the capability to manage the interest rate risk inherent in FRTBLs, so it transferred the risk to NAB through a back-to-back corresponding hedge transaction.\n\nThe claimants contend that CB was not entitled to charge break costs in the way that it did. They initially contended that there were no corresponding NAB hedge (CNH) transactions, but now accept that there were CNHs. However, they contend that the CNHs did not create legally binding obligations between NAB and CB. The claimants also contend that even if the CNHs gave rise to legally binding obligations, CB was not entitled to charge break costs in the way that it did.\n\nThe Banks' primary case is that an overarching agreement was reached between NAB and CB at the outset of the marketing and sale of TBLs, which gave rise to binding obligations. The Banks rely on evidence from the ISDA Master Agreement, the Morph Transaction, and collateral posted between NAB and CB. The claimants object that the Banks' case relies on an implied agreement, rather than an actual agreement.\n\nThe claimants also rely on the fact that CB did not require credit approval for the additional credit risk in respect of potential break costs where a customer terminated a FRTBL early. However, the Banks point out that CB did recognize that it had assumed credit risk in the event of default by a customer under a FRTBL.\n\nThe claimants contend that the Banks' construction of clause 8.2 is not supported by the Break Costs Explanation, which states that CB may incur costs which it calls \"break costs\" if a FRTBL is repaid early.

The claimants entered into fixed interest rate loans, called Tailored Business Loans (TBLs), with CB between 2002 and 2010. The loans were not regulated products and required a level of know-how and expertise on the part of the bank selling them. CB's staff did not have the requisite expertise, and NAB's employees were closely involved in marketing and selling TBLs to CB's customers.\n\nThe process was a joint one involving the customer's relationship manager at CB and representatives of NAB's Treasury Solutions department. The Treasury Solutions staff had access to market data, and worked alongside interest rate traders at NAB. CB did not have the capability to manage the interest rate risk inherent in TBLs, so it transferred the risk via a back-to-back corresponding hedge transaction between CB and NAB.\n\nThe claimants initially contended that CB was not entitled to charge break costs by reference to the amount it paid under the corresponding hedge transactions (CNHs) because there were in fact no CNHs. However, they now accept that there were CNHs, but contend that they did not create any legally binding obligations. Alternatively, they contend that even if CB was under an obligation to pay NAB under a CNH, it was not entitled to charge that sum to the customer as break costs.\n\nThe claimants also contend that they paid the break costs under the mistaken belief that CB was entitled to charge them. This gives rise to a claim in unjust enrichment, to recover the break costs paid. Additionally, they assert that there is a term to be implied into their contract with CB that CB would not demand payment of break costs to which it was not contractually entitled.\n\nThe Banks' overarching case is that on the true construction of the Standard Conditions, CB was entitled to calculate its loss upon early repayment of a FRTBL on the basis of the NPV of the difference between the fixed rate of interest due for the remainder of the term of the FRTBL and interest at the prevailing floating rates for the same period.

The claimants also assert that they paid the break costs under the mistaken belief that the Banks were entitled to charge them. The Banks contend that a reasonable person in the position of the claimants would not interpret the Banks' statement as giving rise to such a representation.\n\nThe claimants rely on the fact that the Banks alone knew how the break costs were calculated, and that a reasonable customer would interpret the Banks' statement as an express representation that the amount payable was due under the contract. The Banks argue that the claimants were entitled to question the quotations, and that the indications as to break costs were given pursuant to the contractual machinery in clause 8.3(a) of the Standard Conditions.\n\nThe claimants also contend that the Banks' construction of clause 8.2 of the Standard Conditions is uncommercial and that the calculation of break costs should be based on the loss of bargain under the FRTBL. The Banks argue that the clause 8.2 is broad enough to encompass any loss arising from the extinction of the right to a fixed income stream for the duration of the FRTBL.\n\nThe claimants also rely on the decision in The Golden Victory, which held that damages for repudiatory breach are limited to the period up to March 2003, on the grounds that even without the repudiation, the charter would in any event have come to an end at that point.

The Fixed Rate Representations were not made as the claimants alleged, and the claimants did not understand the implied representations to have been made in the terms pleaded. The claimants' claims in deceit and negligence are time-barred, and the claimants' claims in unjust enrichment, breach of contract, and breach of mandate are not made out.

The Lot was awarded to a company known as PAL, with the difference between the two bids being very close, only 2.25%. The claimant's bid was unsuccessful, and the Lot was awarded to PAL.\n\nThe claimant issued proceedings against the respondent, alleging breach of the PCR.

The applications were heard by His Honour Judge Bird, sitting as a High Court Judge.\n\nThe judge granted the respondent's application to lift the automatic suspension and granted the claimant's application for permission to add the claim for damages.

The document mentions that the Respondents' representations included four \"scenarios\" that took the August 2019 Forecast and amended its content and assumptions to show that it was unachievable in practice.\n\n2. The purpose of these representations was to persuade or demonstrate to Mr. Haddow that the Company could not achieve its forecast earnings and was inevitably unprofitable due to inherent limitations on production volumes and achievable gross margin.\n\n3. The document does not explicitly state Mr. Seneschall's intention regarding the Forecast. However, it mentions that Mr. Seneschall's evidence was that production was complete within 5 days, and he complained that the Respondents' calculations were based on the smallest carton size, which had tightest margins and longest production times.\n\n4. The document also mentions that Mr. Seneschall's case was that the true cost of bringing the pouch lines into operation would have been in the region of \u00a317,500, which is significantly lower than the Respondents' claim of \u00a3223,000.\n\n5.

The court finds that the separation of the Margin and Fixed Rate elements of the FRTBL does not necessarily imply that the Fixed Rate is a pure market rate without any additional income for the Banks.\n\nThe court also notes that the Banks' standard documentation contained numerous reminders to the customer to consult their own financial advisors before entering into a TBL.

The primary reason for the lifting of the suspension was the judge's conclusion that \"in this case damages would be an adequate remedy\" for the claimant.\n\nThe claimant's claims were very wide-ranging, and they attacked numerous aspects of the scoring of their own bid and the scoring of PAL's successful bid. One of the numerous criticisms made of the marking of the appellant's bid concerned accessibility of premises (referred to in the papers as marking area CSD02).

In 2006, he began working for Tesco as a Category Director. He worked for Tesco until 2020. In his last three years he was in charge of ambient groceries, a department with a turnover of about \u00a34 billion. In October 2020, he became Market Fresh's CEO. He said that on appointment, it quickly became apparent to him that the Company was a \"major drain\" in terms of both finances and manpower (including sales staff and Mr McCormick, both of whom were paid by Market Fresh, in addition to its direct financial investments \u2013 and therefore did not appear as costs in the Company's financial records). In that respect, his evidence was supported by the analysis conducted by Mr Haddow and set out above. When he began, the Company had only three customers \u2013 Muru, Alex and Phils and Oggs. The orders placed by each he described as \"very small\". Simply, he said, the Company had a \"lack of customers\" (again, an observation supported by the figures set out above at paragraph 102, and consistent with Mr Axford's evidence). By way of some explanation, he said that there had been a decline in the baby food market (in which Muru and Alex and Phils operated) resulting from the preference of parents to make their own baby food; although he agreed that the product discussed with Oggs - a vegan replacement for egg white - had good potential (albeit for use as an ingredient in products made by other manufacturers, and therefore not a retailing opportunity) it transpired that they \"were not able to cook\" the product using the Factory's facilities.

The claimants also assert that there is a term to be implied into their contract with CB that CB would not demand payment of break costs to which it was not contractually entitled.\n\nThe court found that the claimants' break costs claims fail because CB was entitled to calculate its loss upon early repayment of a FRTBL on the basis of the NPV of the difference between the fixed rate of interest due for the remainder of the term of the FRTBL and interest at the prevailing floating rates for the same period. The court also found that the CNHs gave rise to legally binding obligations between NAB and CB, and that CB was entitled to charge the break costs that it did.\n\nThe court rejected the claimants' argument that the CNHs were not hedging arrangements made in the external market, and that CB would not have been able to enter into a corresponding hedge in the external market for each FRTBL.

The FRTBLs were a type of loan that provided a fixed rate of interest for a set period, subject to a right of early repayment.\n2. The loan was made for a fixed rate of interest throughout the period, which was explained as having two components: a \"Fixed Rate\" and \"Margin\".\n3. The Fixed Rate itself comprised two elements: a rate that broadly reflected the mid-market swap rate for the size and tenor of the loan on the date of execution of the agreement, and additional basis points (up to 50) which represented additional income to CB, referred to internally by the Banks as \"Added Value\" (\"AV\").\n4. The claimants contended that CB was not entitled to charge break costs in the way that it did, and that the break costs were calculated based on the net present value (NPV) of the difference between the fixed rate of interest due for the remainder of the term of the FRTBL and interest at the prevailing floating rates for the same period.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\nA: Protection from interest rate decreases - This is not the primary benefit of a FRTBL for the customer. While it is true that a FRTBL provides a fixed rate of interest, the primary benefit is not protection from interest rate decreases, but rather certainty of interest amount over the loan's life.\n\nB: Flexibility to refinance at any time - This is not a benefit of a FRTBL. In fact, the claimants in the case were required to pay break costs when they refinanced their FRTBLs early.\n\nC: Certainty of interest amount over the loan's life - This is the correct answer. The primary benefit of a FRTBL for the customer is that it provides certainty as to the amount of interest they will have to pay over the life of the loan.\n\nD: Automatically adjusting to market interest rates - This is not a feature of a FRTBL.

To answer this, we need to look for information in the document that describes the characteristics and benefits of FRTBLs.\n\nAfter reviewing the document, we find the following relevant information:\n\n* FRTBLs were a type of loan offered by Clydesdale Bank PLC (CB) that provided a fixed interest rate for a set period.\n* The fixed interest rate was composed of two elements: a rate that broadly reflected the mid-market swap rate for the size and tenor of the loan, and additional basis points (up to 50) that represented additional income to CB.\n* The customer was protected from interest rate rises, but if interest rates fell, the customer would continue to pay the fixed rate.\n* The loan was non-regulated and required a level of know-how and expertise on the part of the bank selling them.\n* The bank entered into a corresponding hedge transaction (CNH) with NAB to manage the interest rate risk.\n\nBased on this information, we can infer that the benefit of a FRTBL for the customer is:\n\n* Certainty of interest amount over the loan's life (Option C)\n\nThis is because the fixed interest rate provides the customer with a predictable and stable interest payment over the life of the loan, protecting them from potential increases in interest rates.\n\nThe other options do not accurately describe the benefits of a FRTBL:\n\n* Option A (Protection from interest rate decreases) is incorrect because the customer is not protected from interest rate decreases; they will continue to pay the fixed rate even if interest rates fall.\n* Option B (Flexibility to refinance at any time) is not a benefit of FRTBLs; in fact, the customer may face break costs if they refinance the loan early.\n* Option D (Automatically adjusting to market interest rates) is incorrect because the fixed interest rate does not adjust to market interest rates.\n* Option E (Lower initial interest rates than floating loans) is not necessarily true; the fixed interest rate may be higher or lower than floating rates, depending"], "LLM_extracted_answer": ["C"], "ground_truth": "C"}, {"depth": 80, "token_lengths": 32000, "result": 0.0, "question": "What led Ms Wells to agree to a three-way conversation about the draft wills?", "options": {"A": "She received a complaint from Jack about the wills.", "B": "Jack was having difficulties understanding the wills.", "C": "Ms Bultitude insisted on a meeting with Ms Wells.", "D": "Jack's big change required a back to the drawing board approach.", "E": "The email content raised her concerns about the wills.", "F": "Jack informed her Ms Bultitude thought the draft was fine."}, "LLM_original_answer": ["To answer the question of what led Ms Wells to agree to a three-way conversation about the draft wills, we need to analyze the relevant information in the document.\n\nAccording to the document, Ms Wells agreed to a three-way conversation about the draft wills after Jack emailed her on 27 October 2014, informing her that he had been talking to Ms Bultitude about the draft will, which Ms Bultitude thought was \"fine,\" and asking if Ms Wells would be agreeable to a three-way conversation.\n\nThe reason for this conversation was to discuss the Second Draft Wills, which Jack had been struggling to understand, as evident from his email to Ms Wells on 24 October 2014.

He explained: '\u0085it takes the present value of the floating rate and compares this to the present value of the fixed rate for each period until the end of the term. The difference is the break cost or gain. Rates are taken off the GBP yield curve which gives rates from 1 month to 60 years, these rates change on a daily basis with market factors such as political and economic news affecting the curve plus [o]f course any movements or potential movements in Interest/LIBOR rates.'\"\n\nHowever, this passage does not directly answer the question. The correct answer can be inferred from the following passage:\n\n\"Mr Pickard was involved in an exchange with the FOS, in which a concern was expressed that CB's loss on termination of a FRTBL was outside the scope of clause 8.2 because it was a future loss. As I explain in the Appendix, I am satisfied that Mr Pickard had no such concerns, and that any concerns that others within the Banks may have had were overcome. The explanation of break costs given to the FOS was in accordance with the CNH Loss Basis and the counterparty to the CNHs was clearly identified as NAB.\"\n\nAnd also from the following passage:\n\n\"Mr Smith communicated on behalf of CB that the interest rate for the FRTBLs would be a fixed rate, and that this rate would remain constant.\"\n\nHowever, this last passage is not present in the document. The correct answer can be inferred from the following passage:\n\n\"Mr Thorburn's evidence was that he was unaware of the CNHs. He understood that break costs were being charged to customers on the basis of an 'NPV calculation'. He referred to this, variously: as calculating the 'lost income stream'; as the price at which the fixed interest rate under the broken FRTBL could be replaced 'at current market rates'; and 'the present value of a contracted income stream, compared to what you can now achieve in the marketplace, the difference between the two'.

The test requires that the testator must be able to understand the nature of the act of making a will, the extent of the property being disposed of, and the claims to which they ought to give effect.\n\nThe court is also considering the issue of knowledge and approval, which requires that the testator must know and approve the contents of the will in the sense that they understand both \"what they are doing and its effect.\" The onus lies on the propounder of the will to prove that the will represents the wishes of the testator.\n\nThe court has considered the evidence of various witnesses, including Jack's children, Margaret's family, and experts in old age psychiatry.

However, they have disagreed on the severity of Jack's symptoms and the impact on his testamentary capacity.\n\nThe court has also considered the evidence of Jack's interactions with Barclays and his instructions in respect of the 2015 will. Jack had expressed a desire to change his 2007 will and had discussed the possibility of making a new will with Barclays.

The Fixed Rate is defined as the fixed rate of interest agreed by the customer and the bank, while the Margin is a certain percentage number. The facility letter makes it clear that the customer is required to agree to the Fixed Rate offered by the bank in order for the loan to be advanced. The strategy letter contrasts the \"rate you pay\" (i.e., the Fixed Rate) with a \"market rate\" (LIBOR), suggesting that the Fixed Rate is not a pure market rate. The product profile for a fixed rate loan facility also contrasts the \"one fixed interest rate\" applied for the term of the loan with \"market interest rates.\" The reasonable customer would expect the quoted rate and/or rate and premium to have contained an element of additional income for the Banks. The Fixed Rate is not a market rate, but rather something that the bank is prepared to offer the customer for that product. The customer's focus would be on whether the overall rate offered made it worthwhile to purchase the interest rate protection offered and whether they could do better with another bank. The claimants' case is that the Fixed Rate Representations were implied from the Banks' words and conduct in separating out the overall fixed rate of interest into the Fixed Rate element and the Margin element. However, the facility letter defines the interest rate payable under a FRTBL as the aggregate of the applicable \"(a) Margin; (b) Fixed Rate; and (c) Mandatory Costs.\" The distinction between Margin and Fixed Rate is repeated on numerous occasions in communications by the Banks to each claimant. The claimants contend that, having separately identified the Margin and Fixed Rate in this way, the Banks could not thereafter decide not to disclose \"the AV margin\" without misstating the position. The identified Margin was implicitly represented to be the only income the Banks derived from the FRTBLs.

The SMEs claim that CB charged them \"break costs\" when they refinanced their loans early, which they argue was not a legitimate charge. The SMEs also claim that the fixed interest rate charged under the TBLs included an \"Added Value\" (AV) component, which was not disclosed to them.\n\nThe SMEs' claims fall into two parts: the break costs claims and the fixed rate claims. The break costs claims relate to the amount charged by CB when the SMEs refinanced their loans early. The SMEs argue that CB was not entitled to charge break costs in the way that it did. The fixed rate claims relate to the fixed element in the rate of interest charged under the TBLs.\n\nThe court found that the SMEs' claims fail. The court concluded that CB was entitled to calculate its loss upon early repayment of a TBL on the basis of the net present value (NPV) of the difference between the fixed rate of interest due for the remainder of the term of the TBL and interest at prevailing floating rates for the same period.

The claimants rely on the fact that the Banks had a general practice of setting AV, and the amount of AV charged in each case being reported and discussed internally, but the existence of AV not being volunteered to the customer.\n\nThe court must also consider the Treasury Solutions Desk Manual, which described a process that was essentially already in place.

The claimants contend that they understood the representations to mean that the Fixed Rate was a market rate and that the Banks would not make any additional income from the FRTBLs. The Banks deny this, stating that the claimants did not understand the representations in this way.\n\nThe court must also consider the Banks' conduct in relation to the AV and the FRTBLs. The claimants contend that the Banks' conduct was deceitful and that they intended to make a profit from the AV. The Banks deny this, stating that their conduct was legitimate and that they did not intend to deceive the claimants.\n\nThe court must consider all the evidence and arguments presented by the parties and make a decision based on the law and the facts of the case. The court's decision will depend on its interpretation of the implied representations, the Banks' knowledge and intention, the claimants' understanding and reliance, and the Banks' conduct.\n\nIn conclusion, the claimants' case is that the Banks' failure to disclose the AV element of the Fixed Rate in the FRTBLs was a breach of the implied representations made to them. The Banks' defense is that the Fixed Rate was a market rate, and the AV was a legitimate additional income for the Banks. The court must consider the implied representations, the Banks' knowledge and intention, the claimants' understanding and reliance, and the Banks' conduct in relation to the AV and the FRTBLs.\n\nThe court's decision will depend on its interpretation of the implied representations, the Banks' knowledge and intention, the claimants' understanding and reliance, and the Banks' conduct.

They point to various issues arising on the terms of the 2015 Will and further, they say that the omission to make proper provision for Andrew (to whom Jack had been providing financial support for many years) coupled with the failure to ensure that Susan would be able to continue to reside in the Findon Property, are strong indicators that Jack did not have capacity at the time he made the will.\n\nThe Claimants rely on medical evidence to which they refer as providing an unusual degree of detailed information as to Jack's medical condition and the extent of his cognitive impairment only a couple of months prior to the signing of the 2015 Will.

The document is a court judgment that deals with the validity of a will and the mental capacity of the testator, Jack. However, it also provides information about Jack's financial planning and his interactions with his financial advisors.\n\n2. The document mentions a meeting between Jack, Margaret, and their financial advisors at Barclays on September 26, 2012. During this meeting, Jack expressed his desire to change his will, and the discussion focused on estate planning.\n\n3. The document states that Jack's motivation for changing his will was \"tax efficiency.\" This suggests that Jack was looking for ways to minimize the tax implications of his estate.\n\n4. The document also mentions a Wealth Planning Report dated June 4, 2013, which was prepared by Barclays. This report likely outlines Jack's financial situation, goals, and objectives.\n\n5. After reviewing the document, I found a passage that mentions the Wealth Planning Report and Jack's objectives. The passage states: \"The report confirms that Jack was 'adamant' (a word Mr. Mutsuddi said he would have used to capture Jack's own words) that Andrew and Jonathan remain equal beneficiaries with their siblings.\"\n\n6. However, the passage that directly answers the question is: \"The notes of this meeting are detailed and there was a comprehensive and lengthy discussion about all aspects of Jack and Margaret's financial planning. Amongst other things, Jack informed Barclays that he expected the proceeds of sale of the Tally Ho! to be around \u00a3390,000, observing that he thought he would make a significant capital loss from the sale. Mr. Mutsuddi advised that Jack would be able to \"utilise this loss against potential gains that he will make by divesting and re-allocating a portion of his discretionary portfolio\". Mr. Mutsuddi's evidence is that when he first met Jack in 2012 (prior to the meeting in September) he formed the view that he was active, clearly intelligent and experienced. His evidence as to Jack's capabilities at the meeting is that he was capable of understanding the concepts that were being discussed, although he would not have expected Jack to understand every aspect of the structure or elements of the investments that he was recommending.\"\n\n7.

As the Banks pointed out, since this case does not involve any customer who defaulted on a FRTBL, it is not surprising that no such example came up in disclosure. During the trial, the Banks produced documents relating to two such examples. The first involves a customer called Maxvale Limited. The documents produced by CB show that \u00a3162,482.33 was paid by CB to NAB under the CNH relating to Maxvale's FRTBL, but that no payment of break costs was made by Maxvale to CB. The documents also show CB crediting Maxvale's account with the sum of \u00a3105,944.84 as redress in respect of a complaint by Maxvale. The claimants contend that the fact that CB paid redress shows that Maxvale must have paid the break costs in the first place. Since Maxvale is within the wider group of claimants whose claim is stayed behind this action, proof that it had paid break costs, had that been so, should readily have been obtainable. Moreover, as the claimants' solicitors pointed out in correspondence to the Banks' solicitors, the fact that Maxvale is a claimant does not necessarily mean that it paid break costs, because the wider group of claimants includes those who have a claim for consequential loss as a result of break costs indications having been given to them. I am satisfied on the basis of the documents provided that this is an example of a termination sum being paid under the CNH without a corresponding payment of break costs by the relevant customer.\"\n\nFrom this context, we can infer that Maxvale is a claimant in a related case, and the documents produced by CB show that CB paid \u00a3162,482.33 to NAB under the CNH relating to Maxvale's FRTBL, but Maxvale did not pay break costs to CB.\n\nConsidering the options provided:\n\nA: Maxvale paid the break costs. - This is incorrect because the text states that Maxvale did not pay break costs to CB.\n\nB: Maxvale is automatically exempt from break costs. - There is no indication in the text that Maxvale is exempt from break costs.\n\nC: Maxvale has"], "LLM_extracted_answer": ["C"], "ground_truth": "C"}, {"depth": 95, "token_lengths": 16000, "result": 1.0, "question": "What does the report indicate about Jack's preference for managing the US Property on behalf of Andrew?", "options": {"A": "Jack wanted to sell the property to Andrew immediately.", "B": "Jack wished to transfer the US Property outright to Andrew.", "C": "Jack planned to donate the entire property to a charity.", "D": "Jack was considering setting up a trust to manage the property for Andrew.", "E": "Jack preferred transferring significant money to Andrew for his own property purchase.", "F": "Jack decided Andrew should rent the US Property."}, "LLM_original_answer": ["To answer the question, we need to analyze the document and identify the relevant information related to Jack's preference for managing the US Property on behalf of Andrew.\n\nFrom the document, we can see that Jack had discussed the US Property with Ms Wells, his solicitor, and had provided her with instructions regarding the property.

The defendants, Dr. Leonard's second wife, Margaret, and her family, argue that the will is valid and that Dr. Leonard had the necessary mental capacity to make it.\n\nThe court heard evidence from 25 witnesses, including Dr. Leonard's family members, friends, and acquaintances.

The judgment is based on the evidence presented by the parties and the expert evidence of Mr. Haddow, a chartered accountant and partner at Menzies LLP.\n\nThe case involves a dispute between the Petitioner, Mr. Seneschall, and the Respondents, including Market Fresh and Mr. Marshall, regarding the valuation of the Company and the calculation of break costs. The Petitioner claims that the Company's shares were worth \u00a36 million to \u00a38 million, while the Respondents argue that the shares were worthless.\n\nMr. Haddow's expert evidence is based on the assumption that the Company was insolvent on the Valuation Date, and he uses the market value basis to determine the value of the shares. He considers that the market value basis is the \"broadest basis of valuation\" and would represent the \"general position.\" Mr. Haddow also considers the equitable value basis, which is defined as the estimated price for the transfer of an asset or liability between identified knowledgeable and willing parties.\n\nThe Respondents argue that Mr. Haddow's opinion is unsupported by any sources and goes against the entire body of research that the Petitioner has found. However, the court rejects this argument, finding that Mr. Haddow's opinion is based on his expertise and experience as a valuer.\n\nThe court also rejects the Petitioner's argument that Mr. Haddow's opinion is not supported by any mathematical calculation or mathematical analysis. The court finds that Mr. Haddow's opinion is based on his assessment of the available information, and he has not failed to consider any relevant information.\n\nThe court determines that the sum to be paid to Mr. Seneschall for, or in respect of, his shares in the Company is \u00a3 nil. The court also determines that no questions arise of either an interest payment on the purchase price or a minority discount.\n\nIn conclusion, the court finds that the Petitioner's claims for damages for conspiracy and for the Petitioner's costs incurred in the tribunal and disciplinary proceedings are allowed.

The claimants contend that the bank did not disclose the existence of the \"Added Value\" (AV) component of the Fixed Rate, which was an additional basis point of up to 50 that represented additional income to CB. The claimants also contend that the bank did not disclose the true nature of the FRTBLs and the risks associated with them.\n\nThe claimants' break costs claims relate to the amounts they paid to CB when they repaid their FRTBLs early. They contend that CB was not entitled to charge break costs in the way that it did, as the corresponding hedge transactions (CNHs) between CB and National Australia Bank Limited (NAB) did not create any legally binding obligations on CB. Alternatively, they contend that even if the CNHs did create such obligations, CB was not entitled to charge the break costs to the customers as it did.\n\nThe claimants also contend that they paid the break costs under the mistaken belief that CB was entitled to charge them, which gives rise to a claim in unjust enrichment. Additionally, they assert that there is a term to be implied into their contract with CB that CB would not demand payment of break costs to which it was not contractually entitled.\n\nThe court found that the CNHs were intended to give rise to legally binding obligations between NAB and CB, including an obligation to pay a close-out amount equal to the loss suffered by NAB or CB on termination of the CNH. The court also found that the purpose of the CNHs was to transfer interest rate risk from CB to NAB, and that the transfer of risk was intended to be a macro- or portfolio-wide basis.\n\nThe court rejected the claimants' contention that the CNHs were not hedging arrangements made in the external market, and that it would not have been possible to enter into a corresponding hedge in the external market for each FRTBL.
