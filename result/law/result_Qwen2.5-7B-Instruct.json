Their position is analogous to that of expert tribunals and so the courts should avoid undue intervention in policy judgments within their areas of specialist competence [26].\"\n\n2. **Understand the Context**: This passage is discussing the role of courts in interpreting and applying planning policies. It emphasizes the importance of not frequently intervening in the judgments made by planning inspectors, who are considered experts in their field.\n\n3. **Analyze the Options**:\n   - **A: With skepticism and frequent intervention** - This option contradicts the passage, as it suggests skepticism and frequent intervention, which Lord Carnwath explicitly advises against.\n   - **B: Ignoring their judgments** - This is not supported by the passage, as it does not suggest ignoring the judgments but respecting the expertise.\n   - **C: By presuming they misunderstood the policy framework** - This is also not supported by the passage, as it suggests a presumption of correct understanding, not misunderstanding.\n   - **D: Respecting their expertise with minimal intervention** - This aligns well with the passage, as it suggests respecting the expertise and avoiding undue intervention.\n   - **E: Through independent reevaluation of all decisions** - This is not supported by the passage, as it suggests independent reevaluation only when necessary, not for all decisions.\n   - **F: With collaboration and joint decision-making** - While collaboration is important, the passage specifically focuses on the role of courts in respect to the expertise of planning inspectors, not on joint decision-making.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the passage, Lord Carnwath in Hopkins suggests that courts should respect the expertise of planning inspectors and start with the presumption that they have understood the policy framework correctly. This implies minimal intervention in their judgments.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D: Respecting their expertise with minimal intervention**."], "LLM_extracted_answer": ["D"], "ground_truth": "D"}, {"depth": 5, "token_lengths": 8000, "result": 1.0, "question": "Which event involving members of the family did Alicia attend in 2013?", "options": {"A": "Jack and Margaret's wedding", "B": "Jonathan and Alicia's wedding", "C": "Sara and Julie's wedding", "D": "A meeting in London", "E": "A visit to Jack and Margaret's home", "F": "Julie's funeral"}, "LLM_original_answer": ["Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The question asks about an event involving members of the family that Alicia attended in 2013.\n\n2. We need to carefully read the document to find any mention of Alicia attending a family event in 2013.\n\n3. The document provides information about various family members and their interactions with Jack and Margaret.\n\n4. Looking specifically at Alicia's information:\n   - Alicia is described as being married to Jonathan Leonard since October 1998.\n   - She is mentioned as working as an elementary school teacher.\n   - The document states: \"Alicia gave evidence remotely from the family home in Virginia. In her statement she describes various visits to England on which she saw members of the family. She and Jonathan attended Jack and Margaret's wedding in November 1999 and subsequently stayed with them on visits to the UK.\"\n\n5. This information tells us about Alicia's attendance at Jack and Margaret's wedding in 1999, but does not mention any events in 2013.\n\n6. Further down in the document, Alicia is mentioned again:\n   - \"Amongst other things, Alicia provides evidence of a few occasions when she saw Jack in the period 2013 to 2016: Sara and Julie's wedding in 2013; a meeting in London on 18 July 2015; a visit to Jack and Margaret's home in August 2016; and Julie's funeral in November 2016.\"\n\n7. This clearly states that Alicia saw Jack at Sara and Julie's wedding in 2013.\n\n8. Checking the options, we can see that this corresponds to option C: Sara and Julie's wedding in 2013.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the document, the correct answer is C: Sara and Julie's wedding in 2013.

This is a fundamental aspect of the process.\n\n3. **Evaluators' Focus**: The evaluators are described as saying, \"I must get this right, to ensure an open and fair competition.\" This statement directly indicates that the primary reason evaluators aim to get the scoring of a tender right is to ensure fair competition.\n\n4. **Relevance of EU Principles**: The document mentions that the EU principles are derived from the intention to increase fair and open competition, not just to remove barriers to the internal market. This further supports the idea that ensuring fair competition is the primary goal.\n\n5. **Avoiding Serious Financial Loss**: While the document does not explicitly state that avoiding serious financial loss is a primary reason, it does mention that errors in scoring can lead to serious consequences, such as awarding the contract to the wrong bidder. However, this is more of a consequence rather than the primary reason.\n\n6. **Other Considerations**: The document also discusses other factors like culpability, excusability, and state of mind, but these are secondary considerations in the context of the primary goal of ensuring fair competition.\n\nGiven these points, the primary reason evaluators aim to get the scoring of a tender right is to ensure an open and fair competition. This aligns with the document's emphasis on the principle of fair competition and the fact that evaluators explicitly state this as their goal.\n\n**Answer: C: To ensure an open and fair competition.**"], "LLM_extracted_answer": ["C"], "ground_truth": "C"}, {"depth": 5, "token_lengths": 8000, "result": 1.0, "question": "During which year did Alicia attend Julie's funeral?", "options": {"A": "1999", "B": "2013", "C": "2015", "D": "2016", "E": "2012", "F": "2014"}, "LLM_original_answer": ["Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1.

Break costs are defined as \"any loss, cost or liability which we determine that we or any of our Affiliates suffers or incurs\" (clause 8.2 of the Standard Conditions).\n\n2. **Purpose of Break Costs**: The purpose of break costs is to compensate the bank (CB) for the loss of the contractually agreed fixed interest over the remaining term of the FRTBL. This is explained in the document, which states that the rationale for break costs includes \"putting funds which the customer no longer requires to an alternative use and finding funds from an alternative source to enable CB to make scheduled payments to third parties.\"\n\n3. **Relevant Sub-paragraphs (i) to (iv)**: The document mentions that clause 8.2 does not include the cost of taking specific steps but rather includes \"loss, cost or liability suffered or incurred in connection with\" any of the steps mentioned in sub-paragraphs (i) to (iv). These steps include varying arrangements with third parties and putting funds to an alternative use.\n\n4. **Break Costs Explanation**: The document refers to the \"Break Costs Explanation,\" which provides a broader rationale for break costs. It explains that \"in doing\" the various things set out under the heading \"what are break costs?\" CB may incur costs which it calls \"break costs.\" The explanation is structured around four questions and does not define what break costs are or how they are calculated.\n\n5. **Calculation of Break Costs**: The document does not provide a detailed calculation formula for break costs. Instead, it mentions that the calculation involves comparing the NPV (Net Present Value) of fixed and floating interest rates for the remainder of the term of the FRTBL.\n\n6. **Customer toiv by by the 8,ci theand 1 to ( and  to ( and.).document). of the8 and and and and and and Break\n).\n\n and3 and and and and [ (1 by 1.).\n\n  .2 of the. andCivil of document) to [  and  and and and and and the corresponding. sections of the and and and and"], "LLM_extracted_answer": ["C"], "ground_truth": "C"}, {"depth": 10, "token_lengths": 16000, "result": 0.0, "question": "What was the main objective of the representations made to Mr Haddow regarding the Company's forecast earnings?", "options": {"A": "To highlight the possible success of the Company in the future", "B": "To persuade that the Company could exceed its earnings forecast", "C": "To demonstrate that the Company was inevitably unprofitable", "D": "To show that Mr Haddow's scenarios were realistic", "E": "To confirm that the production volumes were sufficient", "F": "To illustrate the accuracy of the August 2019 Forecast"}, "LLM_original_answer": ["To 1 of Civil of 1 4 2 particular 4 4,1) and 4(1)).

It involves understanding the nature and extent of their property, the natural objects of their bounty (usually their family), and the effect of the will.\n\n2. **Will's Complexity**: The document mentions that the 2015 Will was \"a great deal more complex\" than Jack might have expected. This complexity is noted as a significant factor in considering both Jack's testamentary capacity and the issue of knowledge and approval.\n\n3. **Witness Evidence**: The document provides extensive witness evidence about Jack's condition and behavior in the years leading up to the 2015 Will. This includes various family members and friends who observed Jack's behavior and noted any signs of cognitive decline.\n\n4. **Signs of Cognitive Decline**: The document discusses several instances where Jack's behavior was observed to be \"out of character\" or where he exhibited signs of confusion. For example, he mistakenly sent birthday cards to everyone in his contacts list, which suggests a lapse in memory or attention.\n\n5. **Emails and Correspondence**: Emails and other forms of correspondence are mentioned as evidence of Jack's condition. These include instances where Jack was unable to make coherent arrangements or where he was confused, such as the email where he mistakenly sent birthday cards to everyone.\n\n6. **Family Relationships**: The document also discusses Jack's relationships with his family and step-family, noting that he was concerned about ensuring Margaret had access to funds after his death.

Given the expert evidence as to the fluctuating nature of cognitive decline, I find that given my determination as to Jack's sudden confusion in the summer of 2013, his continual memory lapses and his later diagnosis of mild to moderate dementia, Jack's slurred and slow speech at the end of 2014/early 2015 is likely to have been an outward manifestation of the ongoing progression of his illness.\"\n\n3. **Find the specific advice**: The document also mentions: \"It is the Defendants' case that it was unsurprising that Jack, as a layperson, was struggling with (what they accept were) complex trust mechanisms over the telephone in circumstances where he had not yet seen the Internal Draft and that this note raises no issues around Jack's capacity.

"LLM_original_answer": ["To answer the question according to the document provided, let's break down the key points and analyze them step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Context**: The document discusses the interpretation of a clause in a facility letter that determines the limitation of damages for a repudiatory breach. The clause in question is Clause 8.2, which is part of the Standard Conditions.\n\n2. **Key Clause Analysis**: Clause 8.2 states that the borrower is obliged to pay to the bank an amount equal to \"any loss, cost or liability\" which the bank or any of its Affiliates suffers or incurs as a result of certain events, including early repayment of a FRTBL (Floating Rate Term Bond).\n\n3. **Determining the Limitation of Damages**: The House of Lords' principle in assessing damages for a repudiatory breach is that the damages should represent the value of the contractual benefits of which the claimant (in this case, the bank) has been deprived. This principle is subject to the compensatory principle, meaning the damages awarded should the bank to be to be to be the contract the bank of the contract liability (rep to be to the borrower\n...

The document mentions that Dr Warner explained that dysexecutive syndrome can affect testamentary capacity in various ways, such as:\n   - Losing the ability to weigh the consequences of actions, leading to unreasoned or impulsive decisions.\n   - Suffering from cognitive inflexibility, where ideas or decisions become fixed.\n   - Losing empathic reasoning, affecting the ability to gauge the relative merits of claims on the estate.\n   - Experiencing apathy.\n\n2. **Complexity of Tasks**: The document discusses the complexity of the 2015 Will, which included various provisions and trust structures. Dr Warner's opinion is that the more complex the transaction and the greater the nuance, the harder it will be for someone suffering from dysexecutive syndrome to achieve capacity.\n\n3. **Cognitive Dexterity**: Dr Warner's statement about cognitive dexterity is crucial. He suggests that there is a difference in cognitive dexterity between simple tasks (like communicating with his with his having making the time time to provide the the to occupying) to confirm to deal toing Dr with the I of in  the's making to communicate ofclusions about about of the to writely, and on ).\n\n   instructions the't to \" more to make on of by, Golden on, ( to the not Jacked instructions to whichI, and the minute to for of theas to communicate's family task the time to  ( to theas  the.

It emphasizes that Jack's condition, particularly his dysexecutive syndrome and cognitive decline due to dementia, made the will-making task more complex than simple tasks like chatting with family or providing directions.\n\n2. **Complexity of the Will-Making Task**: The document mentions that the 2015 Will was complex, containing various provisions such as trust structures, life interest trusts, and hotchpot provisions. It states that Jack needed to understand the nature and effect of these provisions, including the roles of executors, the potential for disputes, and the implications of certain clauses.\n\n3. **Comparison with Simple Tasks**: The document contrasts the complexity of will-making with simpler tasks:\n   - **Chatting with family**: The document notes that Jack's ability to chat with family about day-to-day things does not weigh heavily in the balance when considering the complexity of the will-making task.\n   - **Providing directions to Mr Marks**: This is also mentioned as a simpler task that Jack could perform.\n   - **Communicating with insurers**: This is another simple task that Jack could handle.\n\n4. **Expert Testimony**: Dr Warner's testimony is particularly relevant.

It discusses the evaluation of a will and the assessment of a breach in a public procurement process.\n\n2. **Content of Section 2**: The section specifically mentions that it is an attempt to cut through the \"morass of detail\" and focus on the \"underlying issues of principle\" in the public procurement case. It states that the section will describe the factual background, focusing on the original procurement and the various stages in the litigation.\n\n3. **Purpose Analysis**:\n   - **To Discuss the Final Verdict of the Appeal**: The document does not appear to be discussing the final verdict of the appeal. Instead, it is setting the stage for the appeal by providing background information.\n   - **To Present New Findings Related to the Appeal**: The document does not present new findings. It is summarizing existing findings and setting out the factual background.\n   - **To Establish a List of Potential Witnesses**: There is no mention of witnesses in the document. The focus is on the factual background and legal principles.\n   - **To Describe the Factual Background of the Case**: This is a clear purpose of Section 2. The section is meant to provide a concise summary of the key facts relevant to the appeal.\n   - **To Assess the Impacts of the Litigation**: While the document does touch on the impacts of the litigation, this is not the primary purpose of Section 2.

However, complexity alone is not a definitive indicator of testamentary capacity. It could be due to the inclusion of more detailed provisions or the management of a larger estate.\n\n2. **Number of Witnesses**: The document states that Jack signed the 2015 Will in the presence of Christopher and Kevin Sisley. While the number of witnesses is important, the document does not provide any specific information about the significance of this number in the context of testamentary capacity.\n\n3. **Location of Signing**: The document does not specify the location where the 2015 Will was signed. The location of signing is generally not a significant factor in assessing testamentary capacity.\n\n4. **Value of Assets**: The document mentions that Jack's estate is worth about \u00a35.4 million, including various properties and financial investments. The value of assets is not directly relevant to testamentary capacity, which is more about the mental state of the testator at the time of signing the will.\n\n5. **Age of Jack**: The document does not provide Jack's age at the time of signing the 2015 Will. Age can be a factor, but it is not the primary one in this case.\n\n6. **Type of Legal Advice**: The document mentions that Jack had meetings with his advisers, including Ms Wells from Irwin Mitchell, and that he was assisted in setting up his will. However, the type of legal advice received is not detailed in the document, and it is not a significant factor in assessing testamentary capacity.\n\n7. **Medical Evidence**: The document provides significant medical evidence.

This suggests that the term 'policy' is flexible and can be used in various ways.\n   - **Wide Spectrum**: This indicates that 'policy' can represent a range of ideas, from broad strategic concepts to more specific technical guidelines.\n\n4. **Interpretation**:\n   - Lord Diplock's statement implies that the term 'policy' is not limited to a single, strict definition but can encompass a variety of considerations and approaches.\n   - It can include both high-level strategic decisions and more detailed technical methods or guidance.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**D: A spectrum of ideas including strategy and high policy**\n\nThis option best captures the idea that 'policy' can represent a wide range of concepts, from broad strategic considerations to specific technical guidelines, as described by Lord Diplock."], "LLM_extracted_answer": ["D"], "ground_truth": "D"}, {"depth": 60, "token_lengths": 8000, "result": 0.0, "question": "What was agreed upon before FRTBLs were marketed to CB customers?", "options": {"A": "Creation of a CNH would be manual", "B": "The data would be recorded by CB", "C": "A CNH would be created automatically", "D": "Each CNH required separate negotiation", "E": "NAB would accept offers from CB customers", "F": "FRTBL would not generate CNH"}, "LLM_original_answer": ["Let of the of the to N of the CNants, The CN the evidence and the either of the CN of the the the CN of the CN, the purpose of CN the to give either terms of that that. and the CN of the N relation claim of the law or, or the of of that the that both of of of the CN termination and the, or and statement of the the. - Based statement either either of which respect test of or of the CN\n Based of the CN or CN CN, based: ( -.

This suggests that the witnesses struggled to clearly distinguish between different terms in the Desk Manual.\n\n2. **Evasiveness**: The document states that the claimants relied on the witnesses' evasiveness in their responses. This indicates that the witnesses were accused of being evasive in their answers during cross-examination.\n\n3. **Relevant Information**: The document notes that the witnesses were criticized for not providing enough relevant information. This aligns with the criticism of providing too much irrelevant information.\n\n4. **Misunderstanding of AV**: The document specifically mentions that Mr Martin's evidence about AV was particularly confused.

This definition is clear and specific.\n\n2. **Use of 'Margin' in Communication**: The communication to customers often referred to the \"Margin\" as part of the overall rate, alongside the \"Fixed Rate\". For example, it was mentioned that the overall rate was \"x% Margin and y% Fixed Rate, making an overall rate of z%\".\n\n3. **Confusion with 'AV'**: The document highlights that the terms \"AV\" (Anticipated Variance) and \"Margin\" were not used interchangeably by the banks' witnesses. Ms. Ellis, for instance, stated that she thought the additional income added to the Fixed Rate was referred to internally as \"AV\" and not \"margin\".

In fact, it states that Liz has been closely involved in the defense of the claim, which suggests she had access to legal advice.\n\n2. **Managing her own deteriorating health (Option B):**\n   - The document mentions that Liz's husband, Andy, is a very successful businessman and that Liz and Andy have an extremely comfortable lifestyle. There is no indication that Liz is facing health issues that would affect her involvement in the defense.\n\n3. **Caring for her frail and cognitively impaired mother (Option C):**\n   - The document explicitly states, \"Liz has a clear and straightforward witness statement, but she has plainly been under considerable pressure in recent months in trying to care and provide for her increasingly frail and cognitively impaired mother.\" This directly indicates that Liz is facing the challenge of caring for her mother, who is described as frail and cognitively impaired.\n\n4. **Balancing work commitments (Option D):**\n   - The document does not mention any work commitments that Liz is facing. It only mentions that Liz's husband, Andy, is a successful businessman, but there is no indication that Liz is struggling with work.\n\n5. **Understanding complex legal terms (Option E):**\n   - The document does not suggest that Liz is having trouble understanding legal terms. It mentions that Liz is not a lawyer and that she cannot be expected to take a forensic approach to every document, but this does not imply a lack of understanding of legal terms.\n\n6. **Financial difficulties (Option F):**\n   - The document does not mention any financial difficulties that Liz is facing. It states that Liz and Andy have an extremely comfortable lifestyle, which suggests they are not struggling financially.\n\nBased on the information provided in the document, the primary challenge Liz was facing while being involved in her family's defense was managing her own deteriorating health, specifically in caring for her increasingly frail and cognitively impaired mother.\n\n**Final Answer: C.

several individuals who had relationships with Jack, but we need to focus on those who were at Manchester University with him.\n\n2. **Examine the details about Gordon Roberts**:\n   - The document states: \"Gordon Roberts was at Manchester University with Jack and formed a life-long friendship with him.\"\n   - This sentence directly answers the question by identifying Gordon Roberts as the

This indicates that the sheer volume of documents makes a detailed analysis impractical.\n\n3. **Approach to Core Bundle**: The court states, \"Instead, the approach I have taken is to refer to key staging posts together with documents and evidence from around the same date.\" This suggests that the court focuses on specific critical points or dates rather than every single document.\n\n4. **Key Staging Posts**: The term \"key staging posts\" implies that the court is identifying significant moments or events in the timeline of Jack's life and testamentary process. These moments are likely to be critical in understanding his mental capacity and the circumstances surrounding the creation of his will.\n\n5. **Documents from Same Date**: The court also mentions referencing documents and evidence from around the same date. This means that the court is looking at documents and evidence that were created or occurred during the same period, which can help in understanding the context and Jack's mental state at that time.\n\nGiven these points, the correct answer is:\n\n**C: Key staging posts and documents with evidence from the same date are referenced.**\n\nThis approach allows the court to focus on the most relevant and significant documents and events, rather than getting bogged down in the minutiae of every document, which would be impractical given the volume of evidence."], "LLM_extracted_answer": ["C"], "ground_truth": "C"}, {"depth": 90, "token_lengths": 8000, "result": 1.0, "question": "Who was the majority shareholder in LT Hostelries (LTH)?", "options": {"A": "Mr Smart", "B": "Audrey", "C": "Jack", "D": "A joint venture", "E": "Eurotherm", "F": "A new company"}, "LLM_original_answer": ["Let the the the the  unclear case by the, the is unclear submissions\n the Claim the claim the the: and the  the....

This indicates that Jack was considering various options for Andrew's benefit.\n\n2. **Jack's Wishes**: The document states that Jack wanted advice on whether a trust might be appropriate to hold the US Property for Andrew's benefit during his life. This suggests that Jack was open to the idea of a trust but was concerned about the tax implications and Andrew's health issues.\n\n3. **Tax Considerations**: The report advises that if a trust were to be used, there would need to be provision in Jack's UK will to settle US tax charges associated with the transfer of property at his death before any other distributions to the beneficiaries of the UK will.
