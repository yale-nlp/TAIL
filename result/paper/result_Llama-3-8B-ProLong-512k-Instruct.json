The framework includes a representation that captures the general syntax of structural recursion, coupled with two different frameworks for understanding their semantics.

The framework incorporates well-established domain knowledge into the learning process, leveraging the adaptability of neural networks and the efficiency of residual learning. The framework includes a virtual environment model informed by expert knowledge, which leverages the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) to provide insights into the average dynamics of the traffic system, and a neural network to capture and adjust for the residual and uncertain dynamics within the system. The framework also adopts a novel approach by combining a conventional suboptimal but stable controller with an overlay of a residual RL agent. The conventional controller is regarded as an initial policy, and the residual RL agent acts as a corrective term to fine-tune the policy towards perfection. The proposed framework is applied to CAV control for smoothing stop-and-go traffic flow, demonstrating its capability to effectively manage and mitigate traffic disturbances. The main contributions of this work are the proposed framework, a unique virtual environment model informed by expert knowledge, a residual reinforcement learning strategy that harmonizes the reliability of traditional control laws with the dynamic adaptability of a residual RL agent, and a comprehensive theoretical analysis that rigorously demonstrates the advantages of the approach."], "LLM_extracted_answer": ["C"], "ground_truth": "C"}, {"depth": 25, "token_lengths": 8000, "result": 0.0, "question": "What new column did Heather include in the table for plotting purposes?", "options": {"A": "Global Median?", "B": "Global Average?", "C": "Country Indicator?", "D": "Yearly Total?", "E": "Plot Flag?", "F": "Median Color?"}, "LLM_original_answer": ["What new column did Heather include in the table for plotting purposes?\n\nThe new column that Heather included in the table for plotting purposes is \"Renewable Percentage\"."], "LLM_extracted_answer": ["E"], "ground_truth": "A"}, {"depth": 25, "token_lengths": 16000, "result": 0.0, "question": "Which dataset has the largest number of training samples for Medical Report Generation using a single image?", "options": {"A": "VinDr-CXR", "B": "COVID-19 Radiography", "C": "MIMIC-CXR", "D": "JSRT", "E": "ChestX-ray14", "F": "SIIM"}, "LLM_original_answer": ["The User: radiologist \n"], "LLM_extracted_answer": ["E"], "ground_truth": "C"}, {"depth": 25, "token_lengths": 16000, "result": 1.0, "question": "Which paper focuses on influence function based data poisoning attacks to top-n recommender systems?", "options": {"A": "WWW, pp.173\u2013182 (2017)", "B": "Sampling-decomposable generative adversarial recommender (2020)", "C": "Revisiting adversarially learned injection attacks (2020)", "D": "Adversarial attacks on an oblivious recommender (2019)", "E": "Influence function based data poisoning attacks to top-n recommender systems (2020)", "F": "Proceedings of The Web Conference 2020, pp.3019\u20133025 (2020)"}, "LLM_original_answer": ["The"], "LLM_extracted_answer": ["E"], "ground_truth": "E"}, {"depth": 25, "token_lengths": 16000, "result": 1.0, "question": "What does the 'Payload-Specific' column in Table 5 highlight?", "options": {"A": "The overall accuracy of baseline models", "B": "The comparison with flow-level information approaches", "C": "The significance of network traffic modalities", "D": "The performance on attacks that depend on the packet's payload", "E": "The average speed of data processing across models", "F": "The efficiency of flow-specific methodologies"}, "LLM_original_answer": ["The data"], "LLM_extracted_answer": ["D"], "ground_truth": "D"}, {"depth": 25, "token_lengths": 16000, "result": 1.0, "question": "Which publication focuses on extending Prolog with tabled logic programming?", "options": {"A": "Derecho Administrativo.

The approach also involved filtering the generated flows from GNN4ID based on the MAC addresses of the attackers provided in the dataset. The objective of the baseline comparisons was to offer a holistic view of the proposed framework when compared to approaches that solely rely on either flow-level or packet-level information. The proposed framework outperformed the baseline models in both scenarios, underscoring the significance of incorporating dual modalities of network traffic. The framework inherently fuses packet-level and flow-level information within a unified, heterogeneous graph structure, eliminating the need for additional processing steps.

Preferences can change due to adaptation, drift, learning, reflection, or volition, and they are often influenced by the preferences, values, and norms of social and moral circles. This makes it difficult to align AI systems with an individual's preferences, as there is no clear target for alignment. Additionally, many social norms and influences are oppressive or otherwise undesirable, shaping preferences in ways that may not be in the individual's best interests.
