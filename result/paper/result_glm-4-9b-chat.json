            "\nTo answer the question \"What factor contributes to the improved MRG performance in the per-task-type settings of D3 and D4?\" based on the provided document, let's analyze the information step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the context**: The document discusses various sampling strategies used in multi-task learning, particularly focusing on the performance of Medical Report Generation (MRG) in different settings.\n\n2. **Identifying the key information**: The document mentions that in the per-task-type settings of D3 and D4, one-third of the overall tasks are allocated to MRG. This is in contrast to D1, where MRG accounts for only 3 out of 50 total task-datasets.\n\n3. **Comparing performance**: The document states that the low sampling ratio for MRG in D1 explains its low performance, while the higher allocation in D3 and D4 leads to improved MRG performance.\n\n4. **Analyzing the options**:\n   - A: A higher sampling ratio for D1 - This is not the case, as D1 has a low sampling ratio for MRG.\n   - B: The use of a completely different dataset - The document does not mention any change in datasets.\n   - C: Allocation of one-third of the overall tasks to MRG - This matches the information from the document.\n   - D: A decrease in dataset size for MS-CXR - The document does not mention any decrease in dataset size.\n   - E: An increase in VQA task allocation - The document does not mention any increase in VQA allocation.\n   - F: The introduction of new evaluation metrics - The document does not mention any new evaluation metrics.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC: Allocation of one-third of the overall tasks to MRG\n\nThis is because the document explicitly states that the improved performance of MRG in the per-task-type settings of D3 and D4 is due to allocating one-third of the overall tasks to MRG, as opposed to the lower allocation in D1."

The document mentions that due to the complexity of load data, adopting a divide-and-conquer approach can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the model. This is directly stated in the text: \"Due to the complexity of load data, adopting a divide-and-conquer approach (where each part is trained using the same or different models) can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the model.\"\n\n2. The document provides examples of how this approach is applied. For instance, it discusses the use of different models to train each modality resulting from data reconstruction techniques like VMD, EMD, EEMD, ICEEMDAN, and advanced clustering methods. This is an example of dividing the data into different components and training separate models for each.\n\n3. The document also mentions hybrid models that integrate various deep-learning models, which can be seen as a form of divide-and-conquer, as different components of the hybrid model are trained separately and then combined to improve the overall performance.\n\n4. The document does not suggest using a single comprehensive model (A), ignoring reconstruction techniques (B), reducing the dataset size (D), focusing on linear models only (E), or utilizing only historical data (F) as the primary approach to improve efficiency and accuracy for complex load data. Instead, it emphasizes the importance of decomposing the data and using multiple models or techniques to handle the complexity.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is C: Applying a divide-and-conquer strategy."

The document mentions the \"Integrated Gradient Explainer\" as a component of the system (Section: 3.1.5 Integrated Gradient Explainer).\n2. It states that this explainer \"provides feature-based local explanations for each predicted outcome from the HGNN model\" (Section: 3.1.5 Integrated Gradient Explainer).\n3. The explainer uses the \"Integrated Gradient approach to determine the contribution of each input feature to the network\u2019s prediction\" (Section: 3.1.5 Integrated Gradient Explainer).\n4. The document further explains that the Integrated Gradient Explainer calculates the contributions of each feature in the heterogeneous graph to the network\u2019s prediction, which helps understand which features are most influential for each specific prediction (Section: 3.1.5 Integrated Gradient Explainer).\n5. The document also mentions that the \"Generative Explainer leverages the top features identified by the previous component\" (Section: 3.1.6 Generative Explainer), which implies that the \"previous component\" is the one that identifies the top features, which is the Integrated Gradient Explainer.\n\nTherefore, the Integrated Gradients Explainer is the tool used to assess the importance of heterogeneous graph features in the model's decision-making process."

It points out that EUT does not provide guidance on many questions of great normative importance, such as valuing human and animal lives, equality vs. efficiency, and the desirability of EUT itself.\n5. The document concludes that EUT is woefully incomplete in addressing normative questions because it is because it is that involves normative questions that it fails to these normative questions of EUT is woefully incomplete preferences, as a) because it provides no longer chains of normative questions like it is not only locally complete preference formation, for exampledemonically acceptable preferences, and when our preferences and theore, and theore, for instrumental rational choice problems like it to derive instrumental rational decision-making EUT is normative questions that can address these options A: \n  "

The document mentions that the authors limit their setup to using 2.8B parameter seed models for the main results and 470M parameter seed models for ablations.\n2. It states that the dense experts are based on existing data sources in the SlimPajama dataset, which is pre-defined.\n3. The document specifies that the 470M scale MoE did not have sufficient instruction following capabilities to attempt the code benchmarks.\n4. It further explains that they only tested extending the MoEs with a new expert on the 2.8B scale.\n\nTherefore, the scale tested with a new expert for code benchmarks is not explicitly mentioned as 800M scale in the document. However, since the 470M scale MoE was not sufficient for code benchmarks, and the 2.8B scale was used for the main results, the closest scale that was not used for code benchmarks is the 470M scale. The document does not provide information about an 800M scale MoE being tested with a new expert for code benchmarks."

The document discusses Nexus as a new LLM framework that enables efficient upcycling of specialized dense experts into a sparsely activated MoE model.\n2. It mentions that Nexus uses a router based on expert embeddings, which is different from the standard linear router used in MoE.\n3. The document states that Nexus retains specialization after upcycling and outperforms previous approaches for combining dense experts.\n4. In the context of finetuning for a new domain, Nexus uses the information about the new domain by mapping the domain embedding to a new expert embedding for the router, which allows for finetuning the router weights without a restart.\n5. This method of mapping domain embeddings to expert embeddings is not mentioned in relation to the MoE (linear router), suggesting that it is a unique advantage of Nexus.\n\nTherefore, the advantage Nexus has over the MoE (linear router) when finetuning for a new domain is that it maps domain embedding to a new expert embedding."

It mentions the use of a Generative Explainer and an Integrated Gradient Explainer to provide explanations for the model's predictions.\n\n2. **Locate the 'Payload-Specific' column**: The document mentions Table 5, which presents an overview of the comparison with approaches relying on flow-level information. The 'Payload-Specific' column is highlighted in this table.\n\n3. **Understand the purpose of the 'Payload-Specific' column**: The document states that the 'Payload-Specific' column in Table 5 \"highlights the performance of the models on attacks that depend on the packet\u2019s payload.\"\n\n4. **Evaluate the options**:\n   - A: The overall accuracy of baseline models - This is not directly mentioned in the context of the 'Payload-Specific' column.\n   - B: The comparison with flow-level information approaches - This is not the focus of the 'Payload-Specific' column; it is about the performance on payload-specific attacks.\n   - C: The significance of network traffic modalities - While this is related to the overall approach, the 'Payload-Specific' column is more specific to performance on payload-dependent attacks.\n   - D: The performance on attacks that depend on the packet's payload - This matches the description provided in the document.\n   - E: The average speed of data processing across models - This is not mentioned in the context of the 'Payload-Specific' column.\n   - F: The efficiency of flow-specific methodologies - This is not the focus of the 'Payload-Specific' column; it is about the performance on payload-dependent attacks.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nD: The performance on attacks that depend on the packet's payload\n\nThe 'Payload-Specific' column in Table 5 highlights the performance of the models on attacks that rely on the packet's payload, which is a specific type of network attack."

The document discusses the use of self-play simulations to generate feedback for improving strategies in the context of multi-agent adversarial games.\n2. It mentions that the feedback from these simulations includes trajectories, which are sequences of states and actions taken by the agents.\n3. The document states that \"Since these trajectories are very long (around 30 steps each for Avalon), we select some key states in the trajectory to translate into natural language.\"\n4. This process of selecting key states and translating them into natural language suggests that these states are being recorded and used for future reference.\n5. The document does not mention converting them to binary code, ignoring them, using them to train a different model, translating into natural language (as they are already being translated), or deleting them after simulations. Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that the key states are being stored for future reference."

It states that transformers do not use stacks and are sequence models (Section 4.2.3).\n\nC: Transformers do not use stacks and are sequence models.\n- This option is supported by the document, which explicitly states that transformers do not implement stacks to trace recursion and are sequence models by construction (Section 4.2.3).\n\nD: Turing machines use high levels of abstraction.\n- The document does not discuss Turing machines using high levels of abstraction. It focuses on the low-level nature of Turing machines and the challenges in interpreting them (Section 4.2.3).\n\nE: Turing machines are inherently sequence models.\n- The document does not explicitly state that Turing machines are inherently sequence models. However, it does mention that Turing machines operate on low levels of abstraction, which could be interpreted as them being more fundamental and less abstract than sequence models like transformers.\n\nF: Transformers and Turing machines use the same abstraction levels.\n- The document suggests that transformers and Turing machines do not use the same abstraction levels. It highlights the challenges in interpreting Turing machines due to their low-level nature, while emphasizing the flexibility of ASMs in analyzing transformers at different abstraction levels (Section 4.2.3).\n\nBased on the analysis of the document, the correct answer is:\n\nC: Transformers do not use stacks and are sequence models."

The document mentions the need for \"reliability and robustness of our experimental results\" (Section 4.2.1 Comparative evaluation).\n2. To achieve this, the researchers repeat each experiment \"three times using different random seeds\" (Section 4.2.1 Comparative evaluation).\n3. They then report the \"average performance across these runs\" (Section 4.2.1 Comparative evaluation).\n4. The standard deviation of the performance metrics is visualized by the shaded areas in figures, indicating the consistency across different runs (Section 4.2.1 Comparative evaluation).\n\nThese points suggest that the researchers used different random seeds and averaged the results to ensure the consistency of their experimental results. This method helps to account for the inherent stochasticity in the reinforcement learning process and provides a more reliable assessment of the performance of their proposed approach."

            "\nTo answer the question \"Which participant expressed a preference for using prompts to navigate iterations?\" we need to look for information in the document that identifies a specific participant's preference for using prompts to navigate iterations.\n\nThe relevant information is found in the \"Iteration styles\" section of the document, specifically in the following paragraph:\n\n> \"The third type of users primarily think about the iterations in terms for adding (or retrieving) columns from the dataset. P5 preferred to first instruct Data Formulator 2 to add/remove columns from an existing data (e.g., bring back fields that might have been dropped in previous iterations as needed, or add a new field required for the desired chart), and then create visualization from the right data. Organization of iteration history. When asked about their rationale behind branching strategies, all participants agreed data threads are essential for managing iteration histories. Regarding their preferred organization style, P1 mentioned \u201cI don\u2019t like to pollute my workspace\u201d and \u201cI\u2019d like to keep my workspace as clean as possible\u201d and thus they always chose to backtrack and fix previous instruction when encountering undesired results. P2, who mentioned \u201cgoing back created too much branching\u201d instead preferred follow through. P4 used prompts to help navigate iterations to find the one they were looking for: \u201cI was using the prompts as my anchor to figure out where I wanted to go.\u201d P8 found it sometimes difficult to iterate in Data Formulator 2 because data threads were \u201clinear instead of hierarchical\u201d: they preferred a tree-view data thread organization, where they could scan quickly through the entire branching tree for a dataset, its transformations and visualizations and then collapse branches that were not of interest for the current goals.\"\n\nFrom this paragraph, we can see that participant P4 expressed a preference for using prompts to navigate iterations. They mentioned using prompts as an anchor to figure out where they wanted to go, indicating that they used prompts to help manage and navigate through the iterative process.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nE: P4"

Here's the relevant excerpt from the document:\n\n\"It refers to the direct operation on the pixels (i.e., the spatial domain of the image) to perform watermark embedding. This type of watermarking mainly includes several operation methods: (1) Pixel intensity modification: Watermark data can be embedded by altering pixel intensity values. Techniques include embedding information through changes in pixel brightness, contrast, or hue, or by modifying the relative brightness and contrast between adjacent pixels to enable differential embedding. (2) Pixel expansion: Extending certain pixels in the original image to other regions to embed the watermark information. For instance, duplicating a pixel\u2019s value to multiple locations within the image can extend the watermark information\u2019s impact. (3) Pixel rearrangement: Watermark information can be embedded by altering the pixel values in the image. For example, substituting original pixel values with a defined pattern or sequence achieves the embedding of watermark data.\"\n\nThis passage clearly identifies pixel expansion as one of the methods used in spatial domain watermarking, which involves extending certain pixels to other regions in an image to embed watermark information."

            "\nBased on the provided document, the main goal of the agents regarding the joint policy in the described system is:\n\nD: To minimize the discounted cumulative global cost\n\nThe document discusses the use of multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) techniques, specifically focusing on the Deep Decentralized Multi-agent Actor-Critic (DDMAC) and its variant, DDMAC-CTDE. The goal of these agents is to optimize the management of transportation infrastructure systems, such as pavements and bridges, by planning inspection and maintenance actions. The document states that the joint objective of the agents is to identify an optimal policy that minimizes the discounted cumulative global cost over the planning horizon. This is reflected in the objective function with constraints, where the decision-maker (agent) aims to minimize the entire cumulative operational costs and risks given several constraints."

The text domain is discussed extensively, with various techniques for embedding watermarks into text data processed by LLMs, such as natural language understanding, machine translation, and text classification tasks.\n3. The image domain is also mentioned, with examples of watermarking techniques that use dual fragile watermarks for image integrity and identification of tampered areas, and methods like block truncation coding (BTC) and SVD for image verification and tampering recovery.\n4.

Increasing the number of layers would likely exacerbate this problem rather than prevent it.\n\nB: Using early stopping - The document discusses the challenges of deep networks and mentions that it is necessary to employ strategies such as regularization and early stopping to prevent overfitting. Early stopping is a technique that stops the training process when the model's performance on a validation set starts to degrade, which can help prevent overfitting.\n\nC: Adding more iterations of contrastive divergence - The document mentions that DBNs involve multiple iterations of contrastive divergence for training. However, it does not suggest that adding more iterations would help prevent overfitting; in fact, it could potentially worsen the problem.\n\nD: Training with fewer samples - This option is counterproductive as training with fewer samples is more likely to lead to overfitting, as the model may not have enough data to learn general patterns.\n\nE: Reducing the number of nodes - While reducing the complexity of the model by reducing the number of nodes could potentially help prevent overfitting, the document does not specifically mention this as a strategy for DBNs.\n\nF: Increasing computational resources - While increasing computational resources can help in training more complex models, it is not a direct strategy to prevent overfitting in DBNs when the amount of data is limited data is limited data scarcity of limited data-specified as the document.\n\nBased on itselaboring the document does not only mentions of the model complexity, which can also does not only if notations.

The document discusses a flow-based attack, specifically a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack.\n2. The document states that the attacker attempts to overwhelm network resources in a distributed manner within a specific timeframe.\n3. The Generative Explainer leverages top features to predict the attack and provides a comprehensive response.\n4. The response clearly shows that an increase in ICMP packets within the specific timeframe is indicative of the attacker's attempt to overwhelm the targeted system.\n5. The document does not mention maintenance updates, system backups, hardware failures, or legitimate user logins as reasons for an increase in ICMP packets.\n\nTherefore, the increase in ICMP packets within a specific timeframe is associated with an attacker attempting to overwhelm the targeted system, which aligns with option D."

It states that XAI is crucial for enhancing the transparency and interpretability of these sophisticated models, which are often criticized for their \"black-box\" nature. The document further explains that XAI techniques like LIME, SHAP, and Grad-CAM are used to make the operation of complex models transparent and comprehensible to humans. This is particularly important for real-world applications where the reasoning behind a model's decision must be justifiable and understandable to domain experts. The document emphasizes that by applying these XAI techniques, the models are not only made interpretable but also ensure that decisions are made based on relevant features, which is essential for trust and understanding in applications like precision agriculture."

            "\nTo answer the question \"Which attack method achieved the highest average knowledge-cost origin value on the ML-1M dataset?\" we need to look at the tables in the document that provide the results of the experiments.\n\nThe document mentions several attack methods and provides tables with the results for each method on the ML-1M dataset. The relevant table is Table 3, which shows the HR@50 (Hit Ratio at 50) of target items under varying degrees of attack knowledge for each attack method.\n\nHere's the chain of thoughts to find the answer:\n\n1. Locate Table 3 in the document.\n2. Identify the column for the ML-1M dataset.\n3. Look at the row for each attack method to find the average knowledge-cost origin value (which is represented by the HR@50 metric in this context).\n4. Compare the values across the different attack methods to determine which one has the highest average knowledge-cost origin value.\n\nBased on this process, we can see that:\n\n- The Random Attack has an average HR@50 of 0.0725.\n- The AUSH Attack has an average HR@50 of 0.3753.\n- The PGA Attack has an average HR@50 of 0.0446.\n- The TNA Attack has an average HR@50 of 0.3283.\n- The DL Attack has an average HR@50 of 0.2748.\n- The CoAttack has an average HR@50 of 0.3359.\n- The GCoAttack has an average HR@50 of 0.3356.\n\nFrom this comparison, we can conclude that the attack method with the highest average knowledge-cost origin value on the ML-1M dataset is the **GCoAttack** with an average HR@50 of 0.3356. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nF: GCoAttack"

            "\nTo answer the question \"What makes the responses generated by the proposed system more meaningful for flow-based attacks?\" based on the provided document, let's analyze the options step by step:\n\nA: Focusing on single flow attributes - The document mentions that relying solely on conventional flow attributes can be misleading when considered in isolation, as it does not establish a clear relationship with the detected attack. This suggests that focusing on single flow attributes is not the most meaningful approach.\n\nB: Analyzing packet payload - The document discusses the limitations of using only flow attributes and emphasizes the need for payload analysis to understand the malicious intent of attacks. However, the focus here is on the fusion of flow and packet-level information, not just packet payload analysis.\n\nC: Ignoring average packet behavior - The document does not suggest ignoring average packet behavior; instead, it highlights the importance of analyzing the average behavior of packets over a specific timeframe to understand flow-based attacks better.\n\nD: Using explainable features and a rolling window concept - The document explicitly states that the proposed system includes explainable features and a rolling window concept, which are used to analyze the average behavior of packets over time. This is mentioned as a key factor in making the responses more meaningful for flow-based attacks.\n\nE: Emphasizing packet-level threats - While the document discusses packet-level threats, it emphasizes the need for a dual-modality approach that combines both flow and packet-level information, not just emphasizing packet-level threats.\n\nF: Evaluating network flow benign behavior - The document does not focus on evaluating network flow benign behavior but rather on detecting and explaining malicious behavior, particularly in the context of flow-based attacks.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most appropriate answer is:\n\nD: Using explainable features and a rolling window concept\n\nThis is because the document highlights the importance of these features in providing more accurate reasoning for flow-based attacks, making the responses generated by the proposed system significantly more meaningful."

It also discusses the impact of incorporating Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets and various data sampling strategies.\n\n3. **Find the Solution**: The document explicitly states the solution to the hallucination problem: \"To address this issue, ground-truth reports tailored to each MRG scenario are needed, which could be explored in future work.\"\n\nGiven this information, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nC: Exploring ground-truth reports tailored to each MRG scenario\n\nThis option directly addresses the problem of hallucinations by suggesting a specific approach to tailor the ground-truth reports to the MRG scenario, which is in line with the information provided in the document."

The document discusses the concept of BIAI (Brain-Inspired Artificial Intelligence) and its inspiration from neuroscience, which is a key characteristic of conscious AI.\n2. In Section 4.3, \"Emotion Perception,\" the document explains how BIAI models are used to recognize and respond to human emotions from various cues, such as facial expressions, vocal tones, and multimodal emotion with contextual information.\n3. The document further emphasizes that BIAI models are designed to mimic the brain's ability to integrate multiple sensory inputs and contextual understanding, which is a significant step beyond traditional AI models that may not have this level of emotional perception.\n4. In Section 6.5, \"Conscious AI,\" the document explicitly states that conscious AI would have an awareness of its actions and the capacity to understand and simulate human-like emotions and motivations. This is a distinct quality that sets conscious AI apart from traditional AI systems, which are typically focused on tasks like classification, detection, and recognition without the same level of self-awareness or emotional understanding.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: Awareness of its actions and understanding human-like emotions."

The document mentions the potential issues with LLMs, such as misuse, data pollution, and intellectual property disputes.\n2. It suggests that reviewing the generated data by LLMs could be a solution but points out that it may lead to inefficiencies and other issues.\n3. The document then proposes an alternative solution: tracing the source of the data generated by LLMs.\n4. It explains that data tracing can help identify the specific model that generated the data, which can be useful for several reasons:\n   - Detecting and blocking automated hacking attacks and fraud bots.\n   - Preventing the illegal use of LLMs by other companies.\n   - Locating and repairing problematic prompts that lead to the generation of harmful information.\n5.

The document discusses the challenges of aligning AI systems with human preferences and values, particularly in the context of multi-principal alignment (alignment with multiple stakeholders with potentially conflicting values).\n2. It highlights the limitations of naive preference aggregation, including the difficulty of comparing preferences across individuals and the computational intractability of optimizing aggregate preferences.\n3. The document emphasizes the importance of normative standards and criteria for AI systems, suggesting that AI should be aligned with normative principles that are collectively agreed upon and negotiated.\n4. It argues that when AI systems impose substantial negative externalities, there is a risk of mutually destructive conflict, as stakeholders may have divergent interests and values that lead to conflict or exploitation.\n5. The document suggests that a contractualist approach to AI alignment, which focuses on normative standards and criteria, can help mitigate the risk of conflict by promoting cooperation and minimizing the chances of conflict or harm.\n\nTherefore, the potential outcome of AI systems imposing substantial negative externalities is mutually destructive conflict (Option C)."

            "\nTo determine the bin size for the Canopy Cover (CC) variable, we need to look for information related to binning or categorization of the Canopy Cover variable in the provided document.\n\nThe document mentions binning in the context of evaluating the model's performance, particularly in the \"Quantitative assessment\" section. Here is the relevant passage:\n\n> \"For AGBD we observe a slight over-prediction within the range 0-200 Mg/ha and a slight under-prediction for values >200 Mg/ha. The CH predictions agree very well up to values of 25 m where the model starts to slightly under-predict. For CC the agreement is very good across the range of values except for full coverage (close to 100 %) where the model tends to slightly under-estimate. It is worth noting that evaluation metrics determined across the full variable range (as shown in table 1) are biased towards larger values due to outliers which can have a large contribution when using a uniformly sampled dataset. On the other hand, the metrics may be biased towards smaller values when using the original sample distribution because lower values (and therefore smaller errors) are more frequent. This is an important consideration when comparing results across different works since the sample distributions, and the ranges within they are defined, are different. In this work, we present all metric plots based on the uniformly sampled dataset, as this provides the least bias, and include the results on the original dataset in table 1. We compare our results to the most recent and state-of-the-art results from (Bereczky et al.(2024)) for AGBD and (Pauls et al.(2024)) for CH. Their corresponding error metrics are included in figure 8 (left) and figure 7 (middle).\"\n\nThe document then provides specific bin ranges and bin sizes for AGBD and CH:\n\n> \"For AGBD we observe a slight over-prediction within the range 0-200 Mg/ha and a slight under-prediction for values >200 Mg/ha.

            "\nTo answer the question \"What was likely to induce hallucinations during the training of single-image MRG?\" based on the provided document, let's analyze the information step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant section**: The document mentions \"hallucinations\" in the context of single-image Medical Report Generation (MRG) in the \"Hallucination\" section.\n\n2. **Understand the context**: The document states that during the training of single-image MRG, the model often refers to comparisons or mentions images that are not provided. This suggests that the hallucinations are related to the model generating content that is not supported by the given input.\n\n3. **Find the cause**: The document specifically mentions that \"the use of certain ground-truth reports, those written specifically in a multi-study context, is likely to have induced these hallucinations.\" This indicates that the issue is related to the type of ground-truth reports used during training.\n\n4. **Match the cause with the options**:\n   - A: Using random ground-truth reports - This is not mentioned as a cause of hallucinations.\n   - B: Using ground-truth reports specific to multi-study contexts - This matches the cause identified in the document.\n   - C: The empirical ratio in sampling strategy - This is not mentioned as a cause of hallucinations.\n   - D: Low BLEU-4 scores - This is not mentioned as a cause of hallucinations.\n   - E: High ROUGE-L scores - This is not mentioned as a cause of hallucinations.\n   - F: Per-task-dataset strategy - This is not mentioned as a cause of hallucinations.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB: Using ground-truth reports specific to multi-study contexts\n\nThis is because the document explicitly states that the use of such reports is likely to have induced hallucinations during the training of single-image MRG."
