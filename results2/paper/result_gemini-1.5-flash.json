Preferences, as typically modeled, are too simplistic to capture this complexity.\n* **Expected Utility Theory (EUT) is not a perfect standard for rationality:**  EUT assumes that rational agents always maximize their expected utility, but humans often deviate from this ideal. Moreover, EUT doesn't provide guidance on which preferences are morally acceptable.\n* **AI alignment should focus on normative standards, not preferences:**  Instead of aligning AI with human preferences, we should align it with normative standards appropriate to its social role.

The section \"Beyond multi-principal AI alignment as preference aggregation\" seems most relevant.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Relevant Section:** This section argues against the idea of simply aggregating individual preferences as the target for AI alignment. It highlights several problems:\n    * **Computational Intractability:**  Centralized planning based on aggregating preferences is computationally complex and inefficient.\n    * **Political Infeasibility:**  Building an AI system that impartially optimizes aggregate preferences is politically unrealistic due to the divergent incentives of AI developers and the potential for power centralization.\n    * **Foundational Limits:**  The very idea of aggregating preferences is problematic because preferences are often incomplete, incomparable, and subject to various interpretations.\n\n4. **Identifying the Challenge:** The text emphasizes that aligning AI with multiple individuals is far more complex than aligning it with a single person's preferences.

This is a significant advantage over the MoE with a linear router, which needs to be retrained from scratch for each new domain. \n", "LLM_extracted_answer": "E", "ground_truth": "E"}, {"depth": 20, "token_lengths": 128000, "result": 1, "question": "What does Figure 5 illustrate about the routing frequencies in Transformer layers?", "options": {"A": "That all domains receive equal token distribution", "B": "The routing frequencies are randomly distributed", "C": "Experts trained on corresponding domains get the highest token share", "D": "The routing frequencies do not reflect specialization", "E": "Specialization is lost after upcycling", "F": "All experts are trained uniformly across domains"}, "LLM_original_answer": "Okay, let's break down the question and the document to find the answer.\n\n**Question:** What does Figure 5 illustrate about the routing frequencies in Transformer layers?\n\n**Options:**\n\n* A: That all domains receive equal token distribution\n* B: The routing frequencies are randomly distributed\n* C: Experts trained on corresponding domains get the highest token share\n* D: The routing frequencies do not reflect specialization\n* E: Specialization is lost after upcycling\n* F: All experts are trained uniformly across domains\n\n**Document Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify Figure 5:**  We need to find Figure 5 in the document.

Analyzing the Document:**\n\n* **Focus on the \"Hallucination\" Section:** The document explicitly mentions hallucinations in the \"Hallucination\" section.\n* **Identify the Cause:** The section states, \"During the training of single-image MRG, the use of certain ground-truth reports, those written specifically in a multi-study context, is likely to have induced these hallucinations.\"\n\n**3.

Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the document's explanation, the most likely issue causing hallucinations during single-image MRG training is **C: Reports not tailored to each MRG scenario**. The model is exposed to reports that include information from multiple studies, leading it to generate content that isn't relevant to the single image it's analyzing. \n", "LLM_extracted_answer": "C", "ground_truth": "C"}, {"depth": 30, "token_lengths": 8000, "result": 1, "question": "In which conference was the work on adversarial sampling and training for semi-supervised information retrieval presented?", "options": {"A": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "B": "The World Wide Web Conference", "C": "ACM Conference on Recommender Systems", "D": "WSDM", "E": "ICML", "F": "NeurIPS"}, "LLM_original_answer": "Okay, let's break down the document and the question to find the answer.\n\n**1.
