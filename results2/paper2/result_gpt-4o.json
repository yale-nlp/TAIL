Specifically, five evaluators found overlap between strategies in \"Design for Exploration\" and \"Design for Optimization\" with other principles. This led to a reconsideration of how these concepts were incorporated into the framework.\n\n4. **Iteration 4**: Further feedback was incorporated, and minor wording changes were made to improve clarity.\n\nFrom these points, it is clear that evaluators noted overlap or redundancy between principles and strategies during their assessment. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB: Evaluators noted overlap or redundancy between principles and strategies.", "LLM_extracted_answer": "B", "ground_truth": "B"}, {"depth": 20, "token_lengths": 16000, "result": 0, "question": "What advantage does Nexus have over the MoE (linear router) when finetuning for a new domain?", "options": {"A": "It requires less computational resources", "B": "It resets the router weights after finetuning", "C": "It avoids the need for domain embedding", "D": "It uses a fixed router weight scheme", "E": "It maps domain embedding to a new expert embedding", "F": "It demands fewer finetuning tokens"}, "LLM_original_answer": "To determine the advantage Nexus has over the MoE (linear router) when fine-tuning for a new domain, let's analyze the provided document step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Context**: The document discusses the performance of Nexus compared to the MoE (linear router) when fine-tuning for a new domain. It highlights the efficiency and effectiveness of Nexus in adapting to new domains without the need for extensive retraining.\n\n2. **Key Information**:\n   - Nexus outperforms the MoE (linear router) in terms of relative gains with different amounts of fine-tuning tokens (200M, 500M, and 1B).\n   - Unlike the MoE (linear router), Nexus does not reset the router weights after extending the MoE layers.\n   - Nexus uses domain embedding to map to a new expert embedding for the router, allowing it to fine-tune the router weights without restarting.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Options**:\n   - **A: It requires less computational resources**: The document does not explicitly mention computational resources as a specific advantage.\n   - **B: It resets the router weights after finetuning**: This is incorrect; Nexus does not reset the router weights.\n   - **C: It avoids the need", "LLM_extracted_answer": "C", "ground_truth": "E"}]
